After months of being completely shrouded in controversy thanks to his fervent support of former President Donald Trump, and claims of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election, Mike Lindell's business, MyPillow, took a serious hit."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

With countless big-box retailers pulling their contracts with the pillow maker, his business has been in fairly hot water for some time.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, David is looking to truly end Mike's reign as a pillow czar by offering a competing product that he claims will be sustainably sourced, made well, and will "not attempt a white supremacist overthrow of the United States government."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">David Hogg's pillow company started from an idea on social media.</h2><p>In a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweet</a> sent out on Feb. 5, 2021, investor and entrepreneur William LeGate proposed to David that they start a rival pillow company to attempt to fully put MyPillow out of business. What ensued next was a hilarious series of events in which William documented his extensive research into the pillow market, purchasing countless other brand's products to sample and discuss features with David in forming their new, ultimate pillow.</p><p>Although many believed that the idea was initially a prank, both William and David confirmed through various tweets that they were indeed serious about the venture, with David <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">saying</a> that "the website will be up in a couple weeks we are very much in the early stages right now." Although he did not say a set date for the pillow's release, the duo has been actively sharing their progress on social media and even seemingly already secured a supplier for their product.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>The pair claim that their forthcoming sleep products will be union-made in the U.S., supportive of worthy progressive causes, and most importantly, not bolstered by anybody who is attempting to cause a supreme level of discourse about the U.S. government.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">MyPillow's business was already in jeopardy prior to David's announcement.</h2><p>Per an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NBC</a> last month, Mike claimed that his MyPillow products were being dropped by major retailers at a high rate. He told the outlet, "a group has attacked my vendors" threatening "a boycott if they don’t comply" and drop MyPillow products from their lineup.&nbsp;</p><p>With a close personal relationship to former President Trump, Mike has been a highly controversial figure ever since the presidential election was held, being one of the most outspoken voices claiming that large scale voter fraud was perpetrated to ensure that Trump lost.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>His claims have landed him in some potentially hot water outside of his business failures, given that now in the legal eyes of Dominion, the company that maintained a large number of voting machines used in the presidential election, has come under fire due to unsubstantiated voter fraud assertions. Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Washington Post</a>, the company warned Mike of potential forthcoming legal action due to his role in perpetuating the unfounded notion.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfma63tcNmn6ifl2K9qrjLqK5mm5%2BivaK62A%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
