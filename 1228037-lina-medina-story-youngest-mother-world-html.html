The modern society is outraged by the cases of the childbirth at 14-15 years, but in comparison with Lina, they seem to be normal.</p><h2>Lina Medina: the youngest person to give birth</h2><p class=align-left>She was born in September of 1933 in Ticrapo, Peru. Lina was quite an average child up to 5 years old when her parents noticed unusual changes in her body — the abdomen began to grow. The religious people from their settlement thought that the changes were caused by the tricks of an evil spirit. Various rites of shamans did not help, so the father decided to take Lina to the doctor. The nearest hospital was in Pisco.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/82feee3166535043.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Ric Ocasek dies peacefully at his home</span></p></a><p class=align-left>They came to the Gerardo Lozada, who was a gynaecologist and, like her parents, presupposed that the cause of the growing stomach <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">was a tumour</a>. However, after the medical examination, everyone was horrified. It revealed that Lina was seven months pregnant. Besides, doctors found out that her first period began at the age of 3 when they usually start not earlier than in 11-12 years old. So even at such a young age, her body was ready to give birth to a baby.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/82feee3166535043.jpg><p class=align-left>Dr. Lozada decided to show the girl to his colleagues in Lima, the capital of Peru. They confirmed the diagnosis. This case stirred out the public all over the world. All headlines were devoted only to this girl.</p><p class=align-left>After a month and a half, Lina Medina gave birth to a boy, and all indicators pointed to the excellent health of the baby. He was healthier than an average Peruvian boy. Although the physical development of the girl accelerated, the width of pelvis did not admit the possibility for the natural childbirth. So, the boy was born by <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">cesarean section</a>. This surgery helped to find out the information about Lina’s body. It came out that the sexual organs were fully developed and the first period started not at 3, but at eight months. Her breasts were growing already at 4 years. The diagnosis was precocious puberty caused by a hormonal imbalance of hypophysis.’</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/6dcc5be43e5f8de3.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The story of Dr Ruth Pfau, the ambassador of humanity</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/254913eab16a09b1.jpg><p class=align-left>Although the young mom and son felt good, doctors kept track of their health conditions for 11 months. It was the first case in history when a 5-year-old girl gave birth. The parents of Lina raised the boy and up to 10 years, he thought that Lina was his sister. He found out that Lina was his mother only at 11-12 years old.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Youngest mother in Nigeria</p><h3>The youngest pregnancy: how has it happened</h3><p class=align-left>Immediately upon the medical examination in Pisco, Gerardo Lozada called the police, who accused Lina’s father. He was the primary suspect to the doctor, public and police. But there was no evidence of the crime and police let the father go. One of her brothers who had mental disability became a second suspect; police detained him but also did not find evidence.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/6dcc5be43e5f8de3.png><p class=align-left>So, there was no documented information about the father of the child.

The following look most like the truth:</p><ul><li>Lina often went to the river to wash clothes, because it was her domestic duty. She always walked alone, and parents supposed that someone could have had intercourse with her there.</li><li>People living in that settlement practised mass ritual festivities. The girl could have been involved in one of those and got pregnant.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/4c1bc48bec75940a.jpg><p class=align-left>In 1939, the San Antonia newspaper expected Lina to come to scientific universities in the USA, but the National Peruvian Midwifery Association claimed that girl should stay in the country under medical supervision.</p><p class=align-left>Later, some American production company offered 5000 dollars to create a documentary movie about Lina Medina: her parents also refused. After it, the government decided that Medina’s family was in danger and established a Commission for their protection. This stopped the journalists’ attacks. Lina valued her privacy and preferred to be discreet.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/420983283382dee7.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>You will never believe what DMX net worth is!</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/44ec301170d718d8.jpg><h2>The further life of the youngest mother ever</h2><p class=align-left>She named her son after the Gerardo Lozada, her attending physician.
