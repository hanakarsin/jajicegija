The term has actually been gaining some momentum on TikTok. Keep scrolling as we unpack it.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Feeling trapped by an unwanted romantic prospect at a bar? Try asking a bartender for an angel shot.</h2><p>What is an angel shot? According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Urban Dictionary</a>, "A guest in a bar or restaurant who's having a bad first date or a bad time with someone they just met can order an angel shot to signal to the bartender or server they need assistance."</p><p>In other words, it's a fake drink order that people who feel they're in danger can ask for to communicate to others that they need help.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>But while the term is new to TikTok, it's not new to the bar scene.</p><p>Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Budget Branders</a>, it arose from the U.K.'s 2016 ‚ÄúAsk for Angela‚Äù campaign, which was designed to prevent sexual assault by urging those who felt unsafe on a date or around another patrol to ‚ÄúAsk for Angela.‚Äù In America, a similar practice was unofficially adopted, but instead of asking patrols for Angela, we ask bartenders for an angel shot.</p><p>And now on TikTok, an audio clip titled <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>–æ—Ä–∏–≥–∏–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –∑–≤—É–∫</strong></a> has become a popular background audio for videos regarding the angel shot. In the audio, background music can be heard as a woman asks a bartender for an angel shot. The bartender shoots back with "Who?" to which the woman replies, "Blue shirt is being aggressive."</p><p>The bartender then assures her that she'll take care of the person in the blue shirt and is seen taking out a bat.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@elianaghen href=#>@elianaghen</a><p><a title=pov href=#>#POV</a> a woman asks for your help at a bar‚Ä¶ <a title=fyp„Ç∑ href=#>#fyp„Ç∑</a> <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=actor href=#>#actor</a> <a title=acting href=#>#acting</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ –æ—Ä–∏–≥–∏–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –∑–≤—É–∫ - volcogot - volcogot" href=#>‚ô¨ –æ—Ä–∏–≥–∏–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –∑–≤—É–∫ - volcogot - volcogot</a></figure><p>But while the above video got a lot of traction (as well as others that also used that audio), it seems there were mixed reactions about it in the comments.</p><p>"Omg I‚Äôm a bartender and never heard of this, I would have failed you ladies, like sorry we don‚Äôt have that," one user wrote.</p><p>Meanwhile, another bartender laid out the protocols used at the bar where she works. "Every bar is different, but our angel shot code was 1. Call the cops ASAP 2. Bar back tell the guy to get out. 3. Escort the lady to her car/her ride," she wrote.</p><p>Others seemed to have issues with how the audio portrayed the angel shot.</p><p>"Making ppl aware [about] angel shots is good but like stop making it look like the bartender is gonna fight them ‚Äî ppl get confused with the real meaning," one user wrote, trying to get the point across that the bartender shouldn't have automatically taken out a bat in the video when she said "Alright, I'll take care of him."</p><p>On Twitter, folks also voiced their thoughts regarding the video. Some were upset that asking for an angel shot was being turned into a TikTok trend.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>tiktok ruins absolutely everything. ‚Äòangel shot‚Äô is meant to be a code word for people in danger or feel as though they are in danger at clubs/gigs. it is not a trend.</p>‚Äî lou | ü§ç (@h0ngmAn) <a href=#>August 2, 2022</a></figure><p>Another <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">person tweeted</a>: "Why is the whole angel shot thing trending on tiktok??
