But between the Wizards of Waverly podcast, part of <a href=#>Christy Carlson Romano</a>'s nostalgia podcast network, PodCo, and the new reboot, we need to know where all the original cast members are now.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Selena Gomez (Alex Russo)</h2><p>Selena is still very much an A-lister. She built up her career as a pop star and actor after her time on Wizards through 17 Top 40 U.S. hits, two Grammy nominations, film roles in Spring Breakers, and more. Recently, she starred in <a href=#>Only Murders in the Building</a>, for which she has been nominated for a Golden Globe and an Emmy for producing the series.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Selena has produced several other projects —13 Reasons Why and Selena + Chef, for example. And she advocates for mental health support since sharing her bipolar diagnosis and struggles with Lyme disease. She also spends time with besties like Taylor Swift and Karol G, so she’s crushing it.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">David Henrie (Justin Russo)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>For those who didn’t watch Wizards of Waverly Place, we might also remember David Henrie from starring as Ted’s son in the future of How I Met Your Mother. But since then, he has kept a low profile in indie films such as Walt Before Mickey and Little Boy. In 2023, he played Ted in Tubi’s Underdeveloped, marching back into the limelight in addition to directing. He and his longtime girlfriend, Maria Cahill, got married in 2017 and now have three children together.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Jake T.

Austin (@jaketaustin)</a></p></figure><p>The youngest of the Russo siblings, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jake T. Austin</a> has certainly had a glow-up. He starred in The Fosters until 2015, after which he voiced roles such as the Blue Beetle in the Teen Titans films and Alex in The Emoji Movie. His most recent role in 2020 was in Adverse, but he has continued to model and split his time between New York and Los Angeles with his two dogs, Bogey and Beju. Jake works with various charitable causes such as Make-A-Wish and Boys & Girls Club of America.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Jennifer Stone (Harper Finkle)</h2><p>The Russos’ bestie, played by <a href=#>Jennifer Stone</a>, was an unforgettable part of Wizards of Waverly Place. Now, Jennifer has been reliving the glory days while co-hosting the Wizards of Waverly Pod. After Wizards, Jennifer took on roles in Harriet the Spy: Blog Wars, Mean Girls 2, and most recently, The In-Between, which she also wrote.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>But in 2013, Jennifer took a break from acting to study nursing and worked as an RN during the COVID-19 pandemic. She now advocates for people with diabetes after her Type 1.5 diabetes diagnosis.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Maria Canals-Barrera (Theresa Russo)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>She may have played a mom in Wizards, but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Maria Canals-Barrera</a> hasn’t aged a day. Since her time on the Disney Channel, Maria has had guest roles on shows like The Big Bang Theory, Fuller House, and Last Man Standing. She starred in Cristela and currently voices Sunset Boulevardez in The Proud Family: Louder and Prouder. She shares two daughters with actor David Barrera, whom she married in 1999.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">David DeLuise (Jerry Russo)</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Wizards of Waverly Pod (@wizardspod)</a></p></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">David DeLuise</a>'s big dad energy didn’t stop him from loving his time on Wizards of Waverly Place. He now co-hosts the podcast alongside Jennifer, despite his fruitful career between his time on the show and now. He had roles in shows like The Mentalist, Grey’s Anatomy, Hawaii Five-0, NCIS, Shameless, 9-1-1, and more. He owns The Big Foot Cafe in Pine Mountain Club, Calif., and he shares two kids, Riley and Dylan, with his ex-wife Brigitte.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLa7rdGdqmanlmLEosLEq6OyZaChrqSxjJyYrKxdo7y4</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
