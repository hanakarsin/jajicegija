With Marvel’s sixth series now under its belt, it’s clear that Marvel shows are quickly becoming a staple of the franchise, perhaps even more so than the films."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Now, between <a href=#>Disney Plus</a> Marvel shows and <a href=#>MCU</a> movies, there’s plenty of new content to dig our teeth into. With Marvel’s sixth series now under its belt, it’s clear that Marvel shows are quickly becoming a staple of the franchise, perhaps even more so than the films.</p><p>The series format gives Marvel a chance to play with expectations, form, and even content without having to worry as much about the project’s box office potential, length, or ratings restrictions. After <a href=#>Moon Knight</a>, which was perhaps Marvel’s darkest and most violent project to date, we’re all wondering what’s next. So we’ve compiled a list of all the upcoming Disney Plus Marvel shows.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Marvel Studios</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">‘Ms. Marvel’ — June 8, 2022</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Marvel Studios</span></figure><p>The only series that has an official date so far, <a href=#>Ms. Marvel</a> stars Iman Villani as Kamala Khan, a 16-year-old Pakistani American girl who admires the heroes. This is our introduction to Kamala before she’s in The Marvels with Monica Rambeau and Carol Danvers.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">‘She-Hulk’ — 2022</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Marvel Studios</span></figure><p>Rumored to be the next series after Ms. Marvel, <a href=#>She-Hulk</a> stars Tatianna Maslany as Jennifer Walters, Bruce Banner’s cousin. Allegedly, Mark Ruffalo will also make an appearance, and Tim Roth will come back from the original Hulk film as The Abomination.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">‘What If…?’ Season 2 — Likely Summer 2022</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Marvel Studios</span></figure><p>Although it hasn’t been confirmed for the 2022 slate, it’s widely known that <a href=#>What If…?</a>’s second season has already been created. It’s just a matter of releasing it. Like the first season, Season 2 will likely jump throughout the multiverse in one-off episodes, yet will hopefully still find a way to surprise us and pull it all together at the end.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Untitled Halloween Special — Likely October 2022</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Marvel Studios</span></figure><p>Since this is a Halloween special, we’re just going to assume it comes out in October. It’s rumored to be Marvel’s first true horror project, and with a wolf on the poster, it’s also likely that it could introduce us to Jack Russell aka “Werewolf by Night.” According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>, Gael Garcia Bernal is already cast.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">‘Secret Invasion’ — 2022</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Marvel Studios</span></figure><p>The new series will tackle what’s been going on with Nick Fury while he was off-world on a Skrull spaceship. We last learned where he really was in the post-credits scene of Spider-Man: Far From Home, so now we’ll finally learn why (hopefully).</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">‘I Am Groot’ — 2022</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Marvel Studios</span></figure><p>We love Baby Groot, and now, Disney is capitalizing on that. And we don’t mind. I Am Groot will allegedly be a new animated series of shorts that follow “Baby Groot’s glory days growing up, and getting in trouble, among the stars.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">‘The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special’ — December 2022</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Marvel Studios</span></figure><p>With Chris Pratt, Dave Bautista, Bradley Cooper, Vin Diesel, Pom Klementieff, and Sean Gunn reprising their roles alongside writer-director James Gunn, The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special is a recipe for success and delight. We’re just hoping it doesn’t disappoint.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">‘X-Men ‘97’ — 2023</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Marvel Studios</span></figure><p><a href=#>X-Men ‘97</a> isn’t technically coming from the MCU canon, since it’s a continuation of the original X-Men animated series. However, now Marvel Studios is bringing it all together with the new 2023 series, which will reportedly pick up where it left off when it was canceled in 1997.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">‘Loki’ Season 2</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Marvel Studios</span></figure><p>We don’t know when it’s coming, but we know that it’s coming! Season 1 of <a href=#>Loki</a> left off with Loki finding himself in the wrong timeline after meeting Kang the Conqueror. Now, we’ll watch as Loki hopefully gets himself out of the mess he’s in alongside Mobius and Sylvia.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">‘Agatha: House of Harkness’</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Marvel Studios</span></figure><p>The <a href=#>WandaVision</a> spinoff series we’ve all been asking for, <a href=#>Agatha: House of Harkness,</a> is all about Kathryn Hahn’s Agatha Harkness. She’s potentially the only witch who can rival the Scarlet Witch. … Could we see another showdown?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">‘Spider-Man: Freshman Year’</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Marvel Studios</span></figure><p>Joining the roster of Marvel shows is another animated series called <a href=#>Spider-Man: Freshman Year</a>. Yes, it’s Peter Parker’s origin story, and no, we don’t need to watch it for the umpteenth time. But in all honesty, if Tom Holland is the voice behind the animated neighborhood Spider-Man, we’re all for it. Plus, it’ll reportedly pay homage to the iconic character’s comic book roots in a completely new way.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">‘Echo’</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Marvel Studios</span></figure><p>We met <a href=#>Alaqua Cox’s Echo</a> in Hawkeye, and although we didn’t see as much of her as we’d like, we saw just enough to get excited about her new series. She makes the turn from evil to heroic during <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hawkeye</a>, and we get a glimpse into her backstory. Hopefully, Echo dives much deeper.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">‘Ironheart’</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Marvel Studios</span></figure><p>We didn’t know we needed more Iron Man content until Dominique Thorne was cast as the titular character. When she’s not suited up, Riri Williams is an MIT genius who builds her own suit by reverse-engineering Tony Stark’s suit under the mentorship of Pepper. Dominique is set to appear in the 2022 film <a href=#>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever</a>, so we’ll likely know a bit about her before <a href=#>Ironheart</a> airs.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">‘Armor Wars’</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Marvel Studios</span></figure><p>Similar to Ironheart, <a href=#>Armor Wars</a> was originally the comic book series that centers on Tony Stark trying to get his tech back after it falls into the wrong hands. This series, however, follows <a href=#>Don Cheadle’s</a> “Rhodey” aka War Machine. Could Ironheart and Armor Wars intersect somehow?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">‘Marvel Zombies’</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Marvel Studios</span></figure><p>We don’t know much about <a href=#>Marvel Zombies</a> except that we got a little sneak peek into what we might expect in What If…?’s zombie episode. It was a horror tease, so we’re hoping that Marvel Zombies digs even deeper into the zombie darkness. It is also an entire comic book series based on a universe that accidentally gets into the main Marvel universe, so there’s a lot to play with.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Untitled Wakanda Series</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Marvel Studios</span></figure><p>This one is far out, but what we do know is that Danai Gurira will be starring in the new series as Okoye.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Untitled Destin Daniel Cretton Series</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Marvel Studios</span></figure><p>Destin Daniel Cretton, the director of <a href=#>Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings</a>, is taking his work with Marvel one step further. Going even beyond the <a href=#>Shang-Chi sequel</a>, all we know is that Destin signed on to direct a Marvel-based series for Disney Plus, not to be confused with his other Disney Plus series based on a graphic novel, American Born Chinese.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqr2ku8yipaBllJ7Ar7HYZqelraNiuqK%2B1Z6jZquYpMS0</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
