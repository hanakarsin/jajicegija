First, in at the 2019 Fast Company Innovation Festival, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Kanye West mentioned his impending presidential campaign</u></a>, and he did not appear to be joking.</p><p>Then, following his failed 2020 run, Kanye (or, Ye, as he <a href=#>changed his name</a>) has now started to discuss running for president again in 2024. Is Ye running a presidential campaign? Keep reading for what we know so far.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Kanye West began mentioning a presidential campaign as early as 2018.</h2><p>On April 24, 2018, he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>mysteriously tweeted </u></a>“2024” without any further comment ... until the next day, when he tweeted, “When we become president we have to change the name of the plane from Air Force one to Yeezy force one.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Kanye West again mentioned his presidential campaign in 2019.</h2><p>Kanye appeared on stage at the Fast Company Innovation Festival with Yeezy shoe designer Steven Smith, and the two of them spoke about the expansion of the brand and the possibility of bringing many manufacturing jobs to the U.S and their efforts to implement more sustainable practices.</p><p>Then, seemingly out of nowhere, Kanye said, “When I run for president in 2024 ...” It was then that he was interrupted by the audience’s laughter.</p><p>“... What y'all laughing at?” Kanye asked. He then continued: “When I run for president in 2024, we would create so many jobs that I'm not going to run, I'm going to walk.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">In 2022, Kanye West tweeted a new presidential campaign video.</h2><p>As most families were wrapping up their Thanksgiving meals, Ye tweeted (and later deleted) a two-minute campaign video announcing his intent to run for president again in 2024 on his recently unlocked Twitter account. The video, which featured several notable celebrities criticizing him, has already begun to circle the internet.</p><p>In the video, titled, "Mar-a-Lago debrief," Ye says he asked Trump to be his running mate in 2024. He also includes clips of actress Vivica A. Fox speaking out against him and encouraging others to boycott him. Her comments stem from Ye's false claim that George Floyd was killed by fentanyl.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=qme dir=ltr><a href=#>#YE24</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/OR60id12oS</a></p>— ye (@kanyewest) <a href=#>November 25, 2022</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Kanye West may have added Nick Fuentes and Milo Yiannopoulos to his campaign team.</h2><p>Additionally, Ye's presidential campaign video may have revealed members of his campaign team. In the video, the "Good Morning" rapper praises Nicholas Fuentes, whom The Department of Justice has referred to as a white supremacist, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Guardian</a>.</p><p>Ye says, "Nick Fuentes, unlike so many of the lawyers and some of the people [Trump] was left with on his 2020 campaign, he’s actually a loyalist. When all the lawyers said, ‘Forget it, Trump’s done,’ there were loyalists running up in the White House, right? And my question would be, ‘Why, when you had the chance, did you not free the January 6ers?’"</p><p>The Guardian also alleges Ye has enlisted Milo Yiannopoulos as his campaign manager.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Vivica A. Fox responded to Kanye West's presidential campaign video.</h2><p>Vivica A. Fox responded to Kanye's presidential campaign video with a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweet of her own</a> shortly after its release. She wrote, "Now dawling if you gonna use a clip featuring me it should be accurate! I was not happy with you [for] saying George Floyd wasn’t murdered, but THANKS 4 watching my @foxsoultv show #CocktailsWithQueens and know two can play that game."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Is Kanye West a Republican?</h2><p>If Ye does run for president in 2024, will it be on the Republican ticket? In recent years, he has expressed right-wing views, befriending Donald Trump, Candace Owens, and many other popular right-wing figures. However, he has not currently declared a party.</p><p>We also know that Kanye doesn’t exactly love being labeled by other people. Is Kanye West a Republican? The only way we could know for sure is if he does actually run for president... and frankly, we’re not so sure we need the answer to that question if that’s the case.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoK6vxcRmrp6rpGK9s7HSopuepqSerq15wpqkqZmZnLs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
