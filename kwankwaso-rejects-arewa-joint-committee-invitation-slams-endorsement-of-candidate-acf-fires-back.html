The spokesman of the NNPP presidential campaign, in a letter dated October 14 and addressed to the organisers, said endorsing a presidential candidate ahead of the 2023 general elections will further polarize the Northern region.
According to Kwankwaso, his decision to decline the invitation hinged on alleged plans by the committee to endorse “a particular northern candidate."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

First of all, he said he is not participating in the dialogue because it coincided with other engagements.</p><p>“We are not calling them to endorse any candidate. I think that accusations like this are a bit weighty.</p><p>“I have not seen any candidate one on one. I have not received any donations from any candidate one on one or collectively or formally or informally.</p><p>“I was taken aback when I saw it. The six groups (that made up the Joint Arewa Committee) pooled resources together to organise the programme.</p><p>“So, if anybody has given anything, I am not aware of it and it has not come to my notice. Our groups are multi-partisan; some people are in LP; some are in PDP, APC, NNPP, and so on. So, you can’t endorse any candidate.”</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> reports that the committee, comprising the Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), Northern Elders Forum (NEF), Sir Ahmadu Bello Foundation (ABF), Arewa Research and Development Project, and Jamiyyar Matan Arewa had invited some presidential candidates for an interactive session in Kaduna.</p><p>The programme, which started on Saturday, was attended by Atiku Abubakar, candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Kola Abiola of the Peoples Redemption Party (PRP), and Adewale Adeboye of the Social Democratic Party (SDP).</p><p>Presidential candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Peter Obi of the Labour Party (LP), and the NNPP candidate are also expected to attend the event in Kaduna today, Monday.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe5BwZqSvkaO4uK3SqGSrnZqasLW%2FjJqpnq%2BRYrewtc2tZJynnaK2tcDEnmSipqaewaLAyKilZquclrq0ecSnm6iqo5q6prrTZqafZZOWu6W1w5qrnmWRmLNussirnKxlkpawrHs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
