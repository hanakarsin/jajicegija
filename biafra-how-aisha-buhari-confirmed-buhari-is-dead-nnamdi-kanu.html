It is impossible and totally unacceptable,” the First Lady had said.</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> reports that Aisha’s lamentation in December came after she had previous stated that the “cabals” have taken over the APC government from President Buhari.</p><p>Capitalizing on the First Lady’s outburst, Kanu said Aisha only confirmed his allegation that President Buhari is dead and had since been replaced by Jubril Al-Sudani from Sudan.</p><p>Kanu, who revealed that his Deputy, Uche Mefor has warned him to stop the allegation that President Buhari is dead, said if Melania Trump, the First Lady of the United States should go the way of Aisha Buhari by saying that President Donald Trump’s government has been taken over by cabals, then the American people would have taken the proper step.</p><p>His words: “I keep saying this every time, my Deputy, Uche Mefor will say don’t say it, don’t say that Buhari is dead.</p><p>“Buhari is dead, is Jubril who is there.It is the truth, I must preach the truth. The world might not want to hear it but I am under instruction that as long as I am behind this microphone the truth must be spoken, the truth must be preached and that is precisely what we are doing.</p><p>“You know why I lost my respect for an average Nigerian? Two things; the 1914 Amalgamation and Jubril Al-Sudani.</p><p>“Now ask yourself this question if the real Buhari was to be alive, what will Aisha Buhari be doing, saying things are getting out of hands in Nigeria? I can’t understand.</p><p>“You are telling me a country full of professors about 9.8 million professors in the zoo, the wife of a so called President is coming out and telling you things are getting out of hand and all of you are quiet, everything is normal and I am asking if Melania Trump will come out and say that things are getting out of hands in America, what do you think will happen to the husband? His poll rating will die down immediately and he would be removed from office.</p><p>“That is why I ask God why I’m I with people who cannot reason? Can’t you ask me to do something else?&nbsp; Why I’m I among them? Aisha is sayings are getting out of hand in Nigeria and people are stupidly blind that they cannot put one and one together to give an answer,” Kanu lamented.</p><p><strong>Listen to the full audio <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HERE</a>.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpgZH1ze5BsZpuhkZu%2FonnHqK5mmZmotaJ5wa6fmqqZYrCwusWiqaadlGKvtrTAq6BmoaNisaatw2alp5mdmbZut8CnrGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
