Last week, more than 10 people were kidnapped at Ikole area of the State alone.</p><p>“In Ekiti under Fayemi and his APC, kidnappers have gone to the ridiculous level of collecting food items, cigarettes, alcohol drinks, etc as ransom.</p><p>“In December 2019, when Ekiti people were preparing for Christmas and New Year celebrations, over 1,000 workers of the State University were sacked and up till now, the court judgment directing their reinstatement is yet to be obeyed.</p><p>“Even when they said they were employing workers, it turned out to be scam as over 100 Ekiti indigenes, whose names had been released as those who were successful among the applicants in the November 2020,<br>Teaching Service Commission recruitment exercise did not get employment letters up till today, after they were made to pay a sum of<br>₦5,000 each for induction, handbook and others.</p><p>“Other achievements that the APC and its candidate will campaign with are the killing of innocent students of the Federal University, Oye<br>Ekiti (FUOYE) by trigger happy security aides of Fayemi’s wife, killings by political thugs, especially during the EndSars protest and<br>the last year’s House of Assembly by-election in Ekiti East Local Government.</p><p>“In September 2019, three students of Federal University, Oye Ekiti (FUOYE), were brutally murdered by security aides of Fayemi’s wife.</p><p>“It is alarming that candidate of the APC in the June 18 governorship election, Biodun Oyebanji is joyfully saying that he will continue with this legacy of killings, sacking of workers, kidnappings and infrastructural decay and we await what they will tell Ekiti people when they mount campaign podium.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ze5BsZp6jmam2brPUm5yrZZOWurGtyKClZq%2BZqbVut8Cypp2dXZuuurHMoqpmmZOdtqbCxKacp6yjYr2lvIymppyjo2Kusa%2BO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
