He also paid a courtesy visit to Governor Oshiomhole at Government House.</p><p>Asked if he is still a member of the PDP,, Tambuwal asserted that<strong> “I am still a member of the PDP”.</strong></p><p>Also, reacting to the directive of the APC leadership that the National Assembly should not pass the&nbsp; Budget, the Speaker said that the directive is meant for&nbsp; APC&nbsp; lawmakers and not for PDP.</p><p>He said, the House of Representatives has been calling on the Federal Government and security agencies to do everything&nbsp; possible to restore&nbsp; peace in&nbsp; Rivers State.</p><p>Speaking at Government House Benin City,, Tambuwal said, <i>“We commend you for your efforts in not only promoting and sustaining very key and important developments in Edo&nbsp; State but also,, promoting democracy and democratic ethics. You are one leader that we appreciate and pray that God will continue to sustain you in good health and may He continue to guide your state and by the grace of God, He will reward you abundantly even after leaving the office that you currently occupy.</i></p><p><i>“We are happy with you and I’m sure the people of Edo State are very happy to have a true and committed nationalist, a pan -Nigerian as their governor. We are in Edo State to condole the Royal Majesty and through the Comrade Governor to the people of Edo State on the transition unto glory of&nbsp; our dear mother, Queen Esther Erediauwa.</i></p><p><i>“From what I was told, she was the head of the harem of His Royal Majesty. That therefore underscores&nbsp; how important she has been in the palace and in the Kingdom of Benin. She has been a very good supporter and comforter of the Royal Majesty. That is why I felt I should come and condole him and the people of Edo State over this loss”.</i></p><p>Responding, Governor Adams Oshiomhole described the Speaker as a role model&nbsp;&nbsp;worthy of emulation by all Nigerians.</p><p>According to the governor,<i> “You have been guided by the overall objective of a parliament that legislates and carries out its oversight function for the purpose of ensuring there is good governance&nbsp;&nbsp;for the common man. You speak in unison on issues that affect national interest. It is a fact looking at national institutions that you are a presiding officer who has been able to make a statement not by mouth but by action that the National Assembly is truly one regardless of the political party.</i></p><p><i>“Let me say that in Edo State, our people admire you a lot for the very effective leadership that you have provided to the House that has a history of instability even when it was dominated by one political party.&nbsp;I am sure most Nigerians admire your leadership style in which you have carried everybody along in the House of Representatives. You are a role model with rare leadership qualities needed by every nation”</i>, he said.</p><p>The Speaker&nbsp; was joined on the visit by five members of the House of Representatives from Edo State, including&nbsp; Samson Osagie, Rasaq Bello Osagie among others.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkgniBl21loaydoQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
