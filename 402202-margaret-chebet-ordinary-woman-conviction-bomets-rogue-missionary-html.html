They took me round in circles until my stay in Kenya elapsed," she remembered.<h3>The highs and lows</h3><p class=align-left>She admits that the energy the story gave her was divine, especially given the coincidences between the orphanage being in her neighborhood in Kenya and Dow living ten minutes from her house in the US.</p>"Every time I wanted to give up on the case, a new door opened. Like this day I was just scrolling through a difference case on Facebook and landed on the ex-wife to Gregory Dow, who had shared about his history with molestation," she explained.<p class=align-left>The one thing that gave Chebet the urge to pursue the case further was learning that any American citizen is capable of being charged in the US even if he commits a crime in a different country.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/47a22d3d2d3bf328_w.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Big is beautiful: 24-four-year old shares her struggles with weight and journey of acceptance</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Since years had elapsed since allegations against Dow came out, Chebet faced the hurdle of convincing people that she had enough evidence against the rogue missionary.</p><i>"After being frustrated from all corners, I decided to just leak the information to our local media house here in Lancaster who published it. From then on the police took up the case and sent detectives to Kenya to gather more evidence," she underpinned.</i><h3>Dow arrested and charged</h3><p class=align-left>In July 2019, Gregory Dow was arrested and Chebet was called to be the voice for the victims as the suspect pled guilty to four counts of abuse against young girls from as young as 11 years old.</p><p class=align-left>Chebet is happy that the victims got justice, a verdict that she calls fair given the duration it had taken for it to be picked up.</p>"If God didn't make me follow up this story, Dow would still be on the streets prowling on the next victims. It is just sad that nothing will ever pacify the victims who suffered under his care, including those who lost their lives," she concluded.<p class=align-left><strong><i>Do you have a groundbreaking story you would like us to publish?
