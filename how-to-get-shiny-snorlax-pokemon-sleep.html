Every week you‚Äôll be tasked with watching over a new Snorlax, and every week there will be a small chance that you‚Äôre given a Shiny Snorlax.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Niantic</span></figure><p>That means the only way to get a Shiny Snorlax in Pok√©mon Sleep is to keep playing the game. The more weeks you go through, the more likely you are to encounter a Shiny Snorlax.</p><p>Players might discover a better method to unlock Shiny Snorlax in the coming months (after all, Pok√©mon Sleep did just launch), but for now, you‚Äôll just need to cross your fingers at the start of each week.</p><p>Keep in mind that it‚Äôs possible ‚Äî and easy ‚Äî to encounter a Snorlax with a unique coloration. Depending on the Research Area you choose at the beginning of the week, your Snorlax might have a different color. For example, Cyan Beach will have you watching over a green Snorlax.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>WAIT A SHINY SNORLAX?? üò≥ The one Pok√©mon that won't stay...

And since the game offers Snorlax in a variety of colors, you‚Äôll need to keep your eyes peeled for this short animation to know you‚Äôve truly encountered a Shiny.</p><p>Also, note that there‚Äôs currently no way to keep a Shiny Snorlax.

If you want to encounter Shiny Pok√©mon in Pok√©mon Sleep, you‚Äôll simply need to get a good night‚Äôs rest.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>EVERYONE SAY GOOD MORNING TO MY FIRST SHINY OF POK√âMON SLEEP üò≠ ‚ù§Ô∏èüî• <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/QakJlc1awq</a></p>‚Äî Vee (@AjentVee) <a href=#>July 24, 2023</a></figure><p>Improving your Sleep Score will improve the odds of more Pok√©mon showing up in your game ‚Äî and the more Pok√©mon you encounter, the more likely it is that one of them will be Shiny.</p><p>You can also feed Snorlax berries, which will entice more Pok√©mon to come visit your location. In other words, you can increase your odds of encountering a Shiny Pok√©mon by increasing the number of Pok√©mon that visit you. For now, that means going to bed at a reasonable time and feeding your Snorlax throughout the day.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby4edOoZKCdpGLAqbXNsmSspp%2BnuaLEjKmmpJ2dpLtuv8uenKk%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
