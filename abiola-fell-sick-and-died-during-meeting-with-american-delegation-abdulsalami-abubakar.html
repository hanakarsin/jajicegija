I remember her very well because of the role she played later.</p><p>“So after the normal courtesy and discussion, when they were leaving my office, Pickering said: ‘Your Excellency, we made a request to see Moshood Abiola but we were denied’.</p><p>“I asked ‘Why were you denied? Who denied you?’ There and then I made a decision.</p><p>“I said ‘Look, you will see Moshood definitely, I overrule whoever said you cannot see him’.</p><p>“So I now called my chief security officer, I said ‘Please make arrangement for this team to see Abiola’.</p><p>“Now, during the incarceration of Moshood Abiola, except his personal doctor, to my knowledge, no member of his family saw him.</p><p>“So when I became Head of State, based on consultation and interaction together with Ambassador Babagana Kingibe, I gave the family a date that they could come and see him.</p><p>“So a day before he died, his family came to Abuja to see him. For one reason or the other, the whole family could not see him at the same time.</p><p>“So it was agreed that when this group of his family will see him today, tomorrow the next team will see him.</p><p>“So they saw him like yesterday. Now, this team from US came to see me and I said they could see him.</p><p>“Normally, it was in the evenings the family go and see him. So because I had authorised the American team to see him, so the other part of the family were waiting to see him.</p><p>“So, it was at this meeting when the American team was meeting Abiola he fell sick and suddenly the security officers called the medical team to come and attend to him.</p><p>“And when they saw the situation they said it was severe and they needed to take him to the medical centre.</p><p>“So it was the medical team plus the American team that took him to the medical centre, unfortunately at the medical centre he gave up.</p><p>“Then my security chief called and said ‘I have bad news for you’. I asked what it was, he said ‘Abiola is dead’.</p><p>“I was shocked. He told me he was there with the American team. At that time I was staying in the barracks, I had not moved to the villa.</p><p>“So I said okay, let him take the American team to my house. I will meet them at the house; so I closed from the office, and went there.</p><p>“The issue now was how do I break the news to Abiola’s family and how do we tell the world Abiola had passed on.</p><p>“I must be thankful to God and again to Ambassador Kingibe because we called on him and asked him to bring Abiola’s family.</p><p>“So when they came I broke the news. As you would expect, the family broke down and they started crying.</p><p>“I can’t remember which of the ladies; I held her, she was crying, sobbing.</p><p>“It was then Susan Rice (that is why I always remember her), said: ‘Mr President, that is not your job, let me do it’’.</p><p>“So, she now held this lady until she settled down and she calmed down a little bit.</p><p>“Then we had to summon my Second-in-Command and other people and then strategised on how to break the news.</p><p>“That is why I always say I thank my God for guiding me. If I hadn’t said the American team should go and meet Abiola, certainly I don’t know how I would explain to the world that Abiola had died.”</p><p>“And the American team; will they believe me that we had not killed Abiola at that time when they were requesting to see him?”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ye5FsZpqamaS5onnFnqOlZaOesKx5wKebZpyZmrFusNSroKefXaKypsDIp55mr5mptW6tzJ6popuRo3qlscuenpqsmaS7bq3Bnaylq5Ghrq61jJqZrpqRoK6zew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
