Peter Obi is part of the old system that I’ve always fought. I understand where he is coming from. It is 1999 repeated, Nigeria wants to change, and some young people are genuinely interested in change, a different direction. And then they are presented with somebody who worked for the establishment; somebody who has been in PDP, APGA, come back to PDP, Labour Party.</p><p>“He’s not new to the rotten system. Somebody who was eight years as Governor of a state. We can be emotional about it but that’s the truth. He didn’t build any schools, he didn’t build any industry, he didn’t have a power station. He’s not my kind of progressive.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH16e49rZmtoYmh6qnnDqKWtZaOasm68xK2cq2Wfl7ZurdJmq6GqlZbBbrTEZqCsZaCWv7V5zp9kraCVYrytsIyssKyslaJ6sLnOspylnV2ovLi70Z5m</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
