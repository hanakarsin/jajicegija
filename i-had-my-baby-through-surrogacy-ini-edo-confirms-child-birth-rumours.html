The eggs are mine and so genetically, she’s my blood.</p><p>“I chose this path to fulfill my dream of becoming a mother. I still have a good number of eggs frozen in case I decide to do surrogacy again or carry my baby myself.</p><p>“I was hoping to talk about her on her first birthday in a few months but mischief-makers beat me to it and spoilt the beautiful story with lies.”</p><p>Speaking further, the actress disclosed that she had miscarriages in the past, saying that her experience did not influence her decision on surrogacy.</p><p>The talented actress added that she opted for a donor because of her fears and her baby’s peace of mind.</p><p>“I had a series of miscarriages in the past but that wasn’t my reason for going this route. I still hope to carry babies In my womb in the future, God willing.</p><p>“I opted for a donor for me and my baby’s peace of mind. Another major reason I opted for a donor is that it scares me so much when I see banter and controversies between a mother and a father over a baby in public forums.”</p><p>The actress, however, denied claims that her child’s father was a married man identified as Kome.&nbsp; Edo stated that she has been friends with him for years, adding that she does not have any romantic relationship with the man.</p><p>She noted that Kome is a responsible family man and doesn’t deserve to be dragged into her motherhood story.</p><p>Edo said: “It is so sad that in Nigeria when a ‘single’ woman is friends with a guy, it must mean to people that they are dating.</p><p>“Kome has been my friend for years and that’s what it is, period. He is a responsible family man and doesn’t deserve to be dragged into my motherhood story.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5ze49sZqJlmJaxbrnYZpmamqliwam%2Bzq6eoWWjqr%2Bzu8aamrJlmaO2brHDqGScp56btrO50maaoaGcmXqjtdGtn2aqpaK8tr7SaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
