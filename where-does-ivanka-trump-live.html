Though she was once a champion for her father's political campaign, she and her husband, Jared Kushner, have tried to return to their cushy lives without the scrutiny that came with working in the White House."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Though she was once a champion for her father's political campaign, she and her husband, Jared Kushner, have tried to return to their cushy lives without the scrutiny that came with working in the White House. And while <a href=#>Donald Trump</a> seems to be eyeing the Oval Office once again, he will do so without his daughter at his side.</p><p>“I love my father very much. This time around, I am choosing to prioritize my young children and the private life we are creating as a family. I do not plan to be involved in politics," Ivanka said in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a> in late 2022, after her father confirmed that he would be running for reelection in the 2024 race. "While I will always love and support my father, going forward I will do so outside the political arena.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Since stepping down from their duties in DC and leaving their temporary residence there, the couple has relocated far away from the capitol city. So where is Ivanka and her family living now? Here's what we know.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Where does Ivanka Trump and her family live?</h2><p>Currently, Ivanka and her family live in Miami, Fla. The Trump-owned Mar-a-Lago club is based in Palm Beach, but despite her father's preference for that specific sector of the sunshine state, Ivanka has continued to put distance between her and her father (even if they are under the same governor).</p><p>The move south was done largely to give the family a bit more privacy than they'd become accustomed to, while also allowing them the access to the warm weather and water sports Florida is known for.</p><p>"They're really just settling into normal life and really enjoying it," a friend of the family's told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> in 2021.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner are building a multi-million dollar mansion in Miami.</h2><p>Following the couple's decision to move to Florida after former President Trump's time in office ending, they've invested millions into a mansion in Miami. The home, which is on Miami's Indian Creek Island, is neighbors to other big names like Tom Brady and Jeff Bezos.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hola</a>, the home has six bedrooms, eight and a half bathrooms, a pool, saunas, sun deck, and much more. It's also connected to a private dock, giving the family access to the waterfront.</p><p>It's not clear when exactly the couple moved into the home, though renovations were reportedly wrapping up at the end of 2023. According to the outlet, the home was purchased for $24 million, though the exact dollar amount being invested into the construction that's taken two years isn't publicly available at this time.</p><p>Though the family will be Miami residents, don't expect to see them out and about too much. Indian Creek Island is an incredibly exclusive and private community owned by Julio Iglesias. As Ivanka and her husband won't be helping her father run for re-election this year, expect the family to continue to keep a relatively low profile as the election process continues.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWmvsRmm6ido2K2t63NpJhmrKKqurF5y6Ktng%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
