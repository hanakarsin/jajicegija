Source: Getty ImagesYou may not recognize the name Austin Richard Post. That’s because he’s better known as Post Malone, which — let’s be real — isn’t a name or face that people tend to forget.
The 24-year-old rapper, singer, and songwriter has become popular for his range of music, true talent, characteristic face tattoos, and eclectic look."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

That’s because he’s better known as <a href=#><u>Post Malone</u></a>, which — let’s be real — isn’t a name or face that people tend to forget.</p><p>The 24-year-old rapper, singer, and songwriter has become popular for his range of music, true talent, characteristic face tattoos, and eclectic look.</p><p>Post goes against the grain in nearly every way, and jokes about his signature look. “On Halloween, [fans] came dressed up like me, which is easy: Just look homeless,” he shares with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Rolling Stone</u></a>.</p><p>And it’s no accident that he fits into a wide range of music genres. Post doesn’t want to be labeled as just one thing, saying that, “Genre is stupid.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Post Malone is open about his music, but his private and dating life are kept quiet.</h2><p>He doesn’t want to be typecast, and actively rejects the notion. “It should just be music, you know?” Post shares with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>GQ</u></a>. “Because I’ve met so many people that’ll say, ‘I listen to everything except for this, or this,’ you know? And I think that’s stupid. If you like it, you should listen to it.”&nbsp;</p><p>So it makes sense that his music is described as “trying to create bops for everyday use — morning jams that double as late-night music, that can fit every time in between.”</p><p>We’re into it.</p><p>Post gets downright salty when there’s too much speculation around who he is — or isn’t — dating. Take this tweet from spring 2019, for example. Post claps back at questions and speculation by asking people to have some respect for his privacy and let him live his life.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>to my REAL fans I love you to death, to the people trying to dig so fucking hard to try and get me to leave my girl, y’all ain’t real fans and it needs to stop.

It was unclear whether it was part of a music video shoot, but Post was later seen again — with what looked to be the same woman — in George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube</a></figure><p>The “yacht babe” scandal hit in summer 2018, and people felt that she looked a whole like Post’s ex, Ashlen Diaz (although it wasn't her).</p><p>Supposedly, this mystery yacht woman is the subject of his infamous “mind your own business” tweet. There's no word on whether they're still canoodling, and he's been hush-hush about his love life since.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">He was with Ashlen for three years.</h2><p>Post had been open about his previous relationship with Ashlen, who he dated from 2015-2018. The couple called it quits in fall of 2018, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Us Weekly</u><u> reports</u></a>. Sources are conflicted over whether Ashlen ended the relationship, or the breakup was mutual.</p><p>In an interview back in 2016, Post was asked what the biggest challenge in their relationship was. “It's tough having a balance between dedicating my life to music and dedicating time for Ashlen," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>he said</u></a>. Ashlen was by his side for the interview.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ashlen was there for Post before he got famous.</h2><p>Of their relationship at the time, a source said, “Ashlen booked Post a show in Dallas before he was big and knew what she was getting herself into. Post loves Ashlen and cares about her but lives his life as though he’s a rock star. He’s still so young.”</p><p>Post, whether you're dating or not, keep doin' your thing like we know you will.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecisZKmno6l6rq3LqKWeZZSWwaq6xg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
