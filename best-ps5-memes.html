That just means there are plenty of opportunities to poke fun at it, even if you plan on buying your own system. There's no harm in a little teasing, right? It's just so easy to joke on, especially if it seems to resemble a router sandwiched between two envelopes. You have to admit, the resemblance is uncanny.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Me: I want a PS5<br>Mom: We have a PS5 at home.<br>PS5 at home:<a href=#>#PS5Reveal</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/SCkPvBL76A</a></p>‚Äî ‚ò†‚úØHalb‚úØ‚ò† (@henry_lancheros) <a href=#>June 11, 2020</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>For the record, it looks like the PS5 will double as a performing arts center. if you don't want to waste time choosing what college you want to eventually attend. &nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>the ps5 looks like a new expensive campus performing arts center that replaced three academic arts departments and cost $60 million dollars <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/mLwL921kRs</a></p>‚Äî but then a strange thing happened (@matthiasellis) <a href=#>June 11, 2020</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Okay, we're not going to dispute this fact.
