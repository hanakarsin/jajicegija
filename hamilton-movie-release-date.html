That's why Lin and the original cast of the hugely successful musical filmed a production way back in 2016 and finally set a release date for the movie to go to theaters."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Turns out, Lin-Manuel Miranda hates that guy, too.&nbsp;</p><p>That's why Lin and the original cast of the hugely successful musical filmed a production way back in 2016 and finally set a release date for the movie to go to theaters. Four years after filming, we've yet to see it, despite the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">massive bidding war</a> that occurred shortly after they shot it, which saw studios attempting to acquire the rights for upwards of $50 million.&nbsp;</p><p>So when is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Hamilton movie release date</a>? It turns out we might not have to wait as long as we thought.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The 'Hamilton' movie was going to come out as late as 2021, but plans have changed.</h2><p>Back in 2018, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wall Street Journal</a> spoke to two insiders close to the movie deal discussions that the plan was to release the film some time in 2020 or even as late as 2021. Reportedly, the reason why the recording wasn't expected to be in theaters until then, despite having been filmed in 2016, was because there was concern a movie would lead fewer people to see it live on stage.</p><p>The assumption, it seems, was that by 2020, the Hamilton fever would have died down and it would be safe to show it in theaters because ticket sales would no longer be as high as they once were. But since <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Broadway is now closed due to the coronavirus</a>, and because of the mandated lockdowns, the company decided to bring it to Disney Plus as of July 3. On May 12, former Disney CEO Bob Iger announced they <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">decided to move the date</a>, so people at home could be simultaneously entertained and inspired.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>We’re thrilled to bring the extraordinary <a href=#>@HamiltonMusical</a> to <a href=#>#DisneyPlus</a> on July 3. In this very difficult time, this story of leadership, tenacity, hope, love & the power of people to unite against adversity is both relevant and inspiring. Thank you <a href=#>@Lin_Manuel</a>!</p>— Robert Iger (@RobertIger) <a href=#>May 12, 2020</a></figure><p>There had been a massive bidding war over who would get to produce the movie, and in February 2020, Disney won. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Deadline</a>, Walt Disney Studios paid $75 million and "won the deal with a commitment for a wide global theatrical release for the 2 hour, 40 minute movie, which was shot two weeks before the original cast left."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Disney presents:<br>Hamilton.<br>With The Original Broadway Cast.<br>Filmed onstage at The Richard Rodgers Theatre.<br>In A Theater Near You.<br>October 15, 2021.<a href=#>#Hamilfilm</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/z4ohfWXzi3</a></p>— Lin-Manuel Miranda (@Lin_Manuel) <a href=#>February 3, 2020</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">While you'll be watching it on-screen, 'Hamilton' won't be formatted like your typical movie.</h2><p>When Lin says "Hamilton movie," it's important to understand that he doesn't mean it's a film adaptation. This isn't like when Les Misérables came to theaters with Anne Hathaway and Hugh Jackman, or when the adaption of Lin's other Broadway hit, <a href=#>In the Heights</a>, was set to hit screens on June 26, 2020.&nbsp;</p><p>Alternatively, this Hamilton movie is a recording of a performance of the original cast at the Richard Rodgers Theatre back in 2016. As Lin told Variety, "What I'm most excited about is that there will be a point at which, you all have that friend who brags, 'I saw it with the original cast', we're stealing that brag from everyone. 'Cause you're all going to see it with the original cast. We're just trying to find the right time to do it."</p><p>It looks like we'll be watching Hamilton on the smalls screen sooner rather than later, and while we anxiously await the July 3, 2020 release date, we'll be shamelessly jamming to the soundtrack on Spotify.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfna6utcutpqdlnaTDqrGMq5ylnZGosm6wwK2c</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
