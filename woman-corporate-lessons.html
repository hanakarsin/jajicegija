A 2021 BBC article cited a 2017 study that indicated only <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">54% of Americans deplete all of their PTO in the workplace</a>. Something that TikToker @taha_haha_ said is a big mistake in a series of TikToks about working a corporate job.</p><p>In the videos, she delineates a ton of tips for folks who are employed in office environments, but one of the biggest aspects of #thatcorporatelife is to "Use ALL of your PTO every year."</p><p>Her reason is: "No one cares that you worked instead of taking time off.

Beneath it, the content creator lists 4 other pieces of advice.</p><p>"2. If you're not getting some kind of raise year to year, find another job. They don't care about you." Economic inflation and costs of goods and services are projected to go up annually, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">even by the smallest increments on average</a>, which means if you're in a position that doesn't see some kind of merit increase from year to year, you're technically taking a "pay cut."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@taha_haha_ href=#>@taha_haha_</a><p>Id be happy to elaborate on any of these ✨ <a title=workfromhome href=#>#workfromhome</a> <a title=corporatelife href=#>#corporatelife</a> <a title=businesswoman href=#>#businesswoman</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - ٴٴٴٴٴٴٴٴٴٴ" href=#>♬ original sound - ٴٴٴٴٴٴٴٴٴٴ</a> <span>Source: TikTok | @taha_haha_</span></figure><p>She also warns against jobs that require employees to have an additional "work cell phone" calling that aspect of the job "exhausting" as workers are expected to be "on call" all of the time.</p><p>Her fourth tip is one that hearkens back to the initial PTO comment, which is "being the hardest working person, doesn't get you as far as you think it would."</p><p>This is a sentiment that is shared in yet another <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">BBC article</a>, which states that hard work alone, without recognition for one's accomplished work, will not necessarily equate to upward career mobility.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@taha_haha_ href=#>@taha_haha_</a><p><a title=13 href=#>#13</a> tends to suprise people.
