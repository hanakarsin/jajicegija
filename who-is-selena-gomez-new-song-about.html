The song is all about a toxic relationship, which is accompanied by a totally devastating music video. And the fans of the former Disney Channel star believe they know who the song could have been written about.&nbsp;</p><p>So, you're probably dying to know <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">who Selena Gomez's new song is about</a>, and fans think the answer is totally obvious.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Selena Gomez's new song about? It's all about a toxic relationship.</h2><p>The lyrics in "Lose You to Love Me" outline a severely toxic relationship, filled with unfulfilled promises and taking what isn't yours.&nbsp;</p><p>"You promised the world and I fell for it/I put you first and you adored it/Set fires to my forest/And you let it burn/Sang off key in my chorus/'Cause it wasn't yours," Selena sings.</p><p>And despite the fact that Selena saw all of the signs that she was in a bad relationship, according to the song lyrics, she completely ignored all of them. The lyrics continue:</p><p>"I saw the signs and I ignored it/Rose colored glasses all distorted/Set fire to my purpose/And I let it burn." Damn.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Fans think the song is all about Jelena.</h2><p>Yep, you guessed it, guys ‚Äî&nbsp;many speculate that Selena's new song could refer to her former relationship with ex-boyfriend Justin Bieber, and honestly, it would totally make sense.</p><p>In case you don't recall, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the two dated on-and-off</a> since they were teenagers, according to CNN, and they'd even reportedly been spotted together not long before Justin reunited with now-wife, Hailey Baldwin.</p><p>In her new track, Selena sings: "In two months, you replaced us / Like it was easy / Made me think I deserved it." So, it certainly could have applied to their situation.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hailey and Justin got engaged later that summer</a> in July 2018 and tied the knot in November 2018, according to ET. Fans of the Biebs weren't thrilled, to say the least, but Selena received a ton of support from fans on Twitter after dropping this new heartfelt jam.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I don‚Äôt know Selena Gomez but i hope she knows I‚Äôm proud of her <a href=#>#LoseYouToLoveMe</a></p>‚Äî Carly Heading (@carlyylalaa) <a href=#>October 23, 2019</a> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>i don‚Äôt care if you hate Selena Gomez but stream <a href=#>#LoseYouToLoveMe</a> bcs that shit hurts <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/TL06djqgQV</a></p>‚Äî üñá (@pinagtripan) <a href=#>October 23, 2019</a> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>And now the chapter is closed and done.
