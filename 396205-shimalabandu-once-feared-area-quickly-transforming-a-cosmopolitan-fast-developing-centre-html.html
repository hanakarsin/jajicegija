The incident made the place named Shimalabandu, where many people's lives ended,"Likeya said.<p class=align-left>According to the village elder, a series of deadly accidents that happened in the area then turned into a black spot cemented the name Shimalabandu.</p><p class=align-left>He said the increased number of accidents was attributed to superstition with elders recommending cleansing rituals to avert future accidents.</p><p class=align-left>In following years, it is said, youths from Batsotso and Isukha communities ganged up and started eliminating the outsiders in order to cleanse the spot’s bad name.</p>“This place needs no introduction. That time non-Isukhas and Batsostso feared residing in the area," Likeya narrated.“Youths from this area were radicalised and they vowed to send away those visiting and seeking to buy land here. From around 4 pm, non-locals would not be allowed to cross the Webuye-Kakamega highway," he added<p class=align-left>He said one side of the road was manned by youths from Butstso and another had youths from Isukha.</p><p class=align-left>The elder said that the ability to speak the two native dialects was the only way to get away from the radicalised youth groups.</p>“There is a ditch where bodies would be dumped. In most cases they had deep cuts, the torture that victims were subjected to was so unbearable,” Likeya said.<p class=align-left>According to Likeya, the two sub-tribes believed that the area was their ancestral land and people from other places were not allowed to settle there.</p><p class=align-left>This is against the Constitution of Kenya which guarantees freedom of movement and association where every Kenyan is allowed to live and own property anywhere in the country without discrimination.</p>"They did all manner of things in protecting it. They believed the fight was in the region’s interest.”<p class=align-left>Locals said that the killings continued through to the 1990s when the construction of Bishop Nicholas Stam, a Pastoral Centre was established in September 1997.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/658a1e734e1af2be_w.jpeg><p class=align-left>The centre, which serves as a church for Catholics, was a relief to outsiders.</p><p class=align-left>Priests and teachers called on the locals to embrace the diversity through accommodation of other tribes, a move which gradually reduced and ended hostility.</p><p class=align-left>Shimalabandu gradually shed its bad reputation and began attracting non-locals who streamed in to buy land for settlement and development.</p>“The centre has transformed the area, it is slowly turning to be a cosmopolitan area since people from various tribes are settling here something that could not happen before," said Fred Mumia, another village elder"This has tremendously contributed to peaceful coexistence and development in this region,” he added<p class=align-left>Shimalabandu’s transformation was also boosted by the improvement in security and the establishment of students' hostels courtesy of establishment of Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology (MMUST).</p>“This place is cool and provides a conducive environment for learning since there is no noise,” said Fredrich Okoth, a second-year student at MMUST.<p class=align-left>Okoth said the area is nothing close to the scary tales of the past, saying it is secure and locals are warm and welcoming.</p><p class=align-left><strong><i>Story by Dennis Avokoywa, TUKO.co.ke correspondent - Kakamega county.</i></strong></p><p class=align-left><strong><i>Do you have a groundbreaking story you would like us to publish?
