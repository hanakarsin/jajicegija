APC has done well.</p><p>“They tried to break our ranks. And this is possible because of our man in Rivers who sold out. He has consistently tried to destroy the party. Yes, it’s true that we have weaknesses in PDP. We don’t know how to play the opposition. That is why APC which specializes in playing the opposition, was able to thrive against us.</p><p>“Those erring members will need the party at all times. They will always want to come back to the party. The party has its stick. Yes, it’s weakened now, but we are still in the court. All our attention now has been in the court. So it’s a distraction right now if you ask me. The big picture we are after is the court.</p><p>“The party is supreme. We are going to restructure it. Because whether they it or not, they are party men, and I believe they’ll listen to us. We are looking at the big picture. Ninety per cent of our attention at the moment is geared towards the court. And in the last meeting we had two weeks ago, these issues were brought up, and we said, look, we are going to set up a committee to look into this. Those that will be punished will be punished. “</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e49vZqmcoGK2tHnWnpiknZ6asW66zrBkqK2iYrqiuoyipWaqmauys7%2BMrKalnF2qwG671K1kqZygYrK5ec2aq6Knnpa5bsLInJxmm5iWtrO5wKdkrJmpqHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
