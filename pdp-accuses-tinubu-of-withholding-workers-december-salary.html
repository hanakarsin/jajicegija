We ask, where is the money?</p><p>“Our Party is appalled by the level of profligacy apparent in the APC administration whose actions and policies are skewed towards the promotion and institutionalization of corruption, deprivation and suppression of Nigerians.</p><p>“Nigerians will recall that earlier in August, the PDP alerted that our nation’s economy was asphyxiating and grinding to a halt under the increasingly corrupt APC and President Tinubu’s crippling economic policies with consequential negative toll on productivity.</p><p>“The failure to pay December salary of workers further confirms that the Tinubu-led APC administration has practically ran our nation’s economy aground with its corruption, recklessness and ill-informed counter-productive policies.</p><p>“The PDP demands that President Tinubu immediately account for the trillions of naira accruable from the removal of subsidy on petroleum products in the last seven months.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH5ze5JpZqmcoGKupK%2FUrJysZaSeu7au1Gamn2WnnsGptM6lm6Kml2LEsL7KnqmsZZSasKa5wZ6pZquRoa6zxY4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
