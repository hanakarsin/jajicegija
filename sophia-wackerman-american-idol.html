"Music to me is life," she says. "And I know that sounds cheesy, but there's music everywhere. There's music in nature, there's music constantly in our brains, there's music in our souls ... and it's a way to connect with people."</p><p>Sophia was born to a family of artists â€” her dad is a drummer and her mom was a singer â€” and she herself has had musical inclinations her entire life. "I took to singing really early on," she says, then studied theory, theater, and piano. But from those early days, Sophia "never stopped singing," she says.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: instagram</span></figure><p>Sophia is set to graduate from UCLA in 2022, and works as a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">vocal coach</a> in the little time she has between extracurricular activities. Outside of class, Sophia is really plugged into LA's music and jazz scene.&nbsp;</p><p>She arranges music and sings for the Harmony Project's Foshay Jazz Ensemble, sings a cappella for the university's all-gender student-run group, the UCLA Scattertones, and even finds the time to balance her own musical songwriter projects with this busy schedule.</p><p>"If I were to describe my music thus far, it would be honest," she says with a laugh. Genre-wise, she calls her sound a fusion of rock, pop, and soul, "if I were to describe it," she says.&nbsp;</p><p>Sophia also notes that her time at UCLA has really taught her about the importance of collaboration, something that will certainly come in handy as she climbs the ranks of American Idol.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Whenever Iâ€™d watch Peter Pan as a kid, Iâ€™d never pay attention to this song.
