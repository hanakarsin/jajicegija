It is also called hypnotism.”</i></p><p class=align-left>He claimed that while T.B Joshua uses Kabballah magic to hypnotize his congregation and the general public over his miracles, Chris Oyakhilome’s association with Joshua makes him a suspect.</p><p class=align-left>Taking on Oyakhilome, Peller said: <i>“I used to believe Oyakhilome before. That ended the day I saw him and Joshua doing miracles and castigating our pastors, Ayo and Okonkwo.</i></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/1120/vllkytvnq41l2g33o.jpeg><p class=align-left><i>“When you castigate these great men of God, you are no more for God. They do miracles but don’t know what they teach.</i></p><p class=align-left><i>“I would say they use magic on their followers since I was a former magician. I see in their actions hypnotism and seduction. I mean the way we used to seduce our congregation; those that come to watch our magic those days.</i></p><p class=align-left><i>“I see mesmerism, hypnotism and occult display in what they do. How can people jubilate over atmosphere of miracles and before they get to the bus stop, the miracles have gone. Miracles are not limited to atmosphere. God is in charge of everywhere,” </i>he added.</p><p class=align-left>According to the Bishop: <i>“They use the eyes with the demonic power in them to superimpose their thoughts into people. It happens, for most of those walking in the streets have very weak spirits. For there is witchcraft ability in every man.</i></p><p class=align-left><i>“That is what we call telepathising: I mean, when I see them do their drama of healing while dancing from one side to another. I know its hypnotism.</i></p><p class=align-left><i>“These are dangerous occultist words. Telepathising, hypnotism, occultism, kabbalah magic are processes of ruling the minds of weaker men. It could go to the length of seeing the magic maker in the dreams once the weaker person allows the demonic spirit of the conjurer to influence his mind.”</i></p><p class=align-left>Defending his criticism on the duo, the reformer said: <i>“Let nobody think that I am jealous of them because their churches are big. If I want to make mine big I know what to do. I am the son of Peller. I know where things happen.</i></p><p class=align-left><i>“I am not a ‘mugu’, to say the truth. They can’t fool me. I want to make heaven. I don’t want my work to be a waste; for every work built on faulty foundation, shall not stand the test of time.</i></p><p class=align-left><i>“Foundation of deceit, occultism and demonic power cannot stand the test of time when the owner leaves. Jesus will deny them on that day.</i></p><p class=align-left><i>“God only can say if Joshua is a real man of God. I don’t judge them; only God can do that.</i></p><p class=align-left><i>“Having said all these, I have nothing against them. For I feel that nothing can be except God allows,”</i> Bishop Kayode quipped.</p><p class=align-left>It would be recalled that about a fortnight ago, a very popular Ghanaian witch doctor, Nana Kwaku Bonsam said T.B Joshua comes to him to acquire spiritual powers. He challenged the Nigerian prophet to come out openly to deny.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkhHOEkmloZqqVq7KiuMSdZKGnp2LBo3nJqKqhrZFivaK%2F06ipZpuYp7a0edSsnGabmJa%2Frr%2BMraZmqJWns7C%2BzGakoqqRmLmmv42hq6ak</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
