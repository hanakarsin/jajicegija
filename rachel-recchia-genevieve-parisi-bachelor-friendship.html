"We have seen each other through so much. And to have someone right next to my room to constantly be there, no matter what, it's been so nice."</p><p>Gen explained to us that since they both share similar experiences as part of Bachelor Nation, they are able to understand "what each other goes through" and are "able to understand each other's needs."</p><p>"It's definitely a special type of bond. I don't think you can really find it with anyone who hasn't been through what we've been through," Gen added.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Rachel Recchia (@pilot.rachel)</a></p></figure><p>Plus, another added benefit of being roomies with your bestie is that you can dish on your dates. While both women aren't seriously dating anyone at the current moment, both Gen and Rachel told us that they will "weigh in" on the other's date.</p><p>"One of us will come home from a date and then we'll [say] tell me everything, and then we just dish everything," Rachel said. "So it's really nice to have her here before and after the date."</p><p>"I don't think either of us would ever go on a date without talking to the other right before and right after," Gen added. "So whoever the next person I'm dating is should take [Rachel's opinion] into account."</p><p>While both women agree that their dating lives have been pretty "mellow," Gen revealed that they are trying to put themselves "back out there."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Genevieve Parisi (@genparisi)</a></p></figure><p>Well, both Gen and Rachel will certainly be living their best lives at California's most popular music festival, <a href=#>Coachella</a>.
