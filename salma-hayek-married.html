By 2007, they welcomed a child together — daughter Valentina.</p><p>François is the CEO and chairman of Kering, a luxury goods company that owns fashion brands including Gucci, Balenciaga, and Alexander McQueen. In 2019, Salma called him the "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">best husband in the world</a>."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Salma with husband François-Henri Pinault and their daughter Valentina in 2021</p></figure><p>But apparently, marriage wasn't always in the cards for the <a href=#>Eternals</a> star. Salma admitted in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Glamour</a> magazine's February 2023 cover story that her parents and brother "dragged" her to the courthouse to get married, as she had a "phobia" of getting hitched.</p><p>She later realized her fears had been unfounded and that she was quite happy with her decision — so much so that a few months later, she celebrated with a traditional ceremony in Italy.</p><p>These days, she enjoys a quiet life with her husband and delights in the "boredom" that comes with a longtime partnership.</p><p>"Boredom is underestimated; I didn't understand this for a long time," she said. "Also, it helps that we met each other later in our lives. It's OK just to do nothing and be together; sometimes sharing a space and doing your own thing in silence, with connectivity and thoughtfulness — 'Can I bring you a cup of tea?' — is enough. It's little simple things."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Salma and François in 2021</p></figure><p>Still, she recognizes the importance of alone time. When asked about advice she'd give other women in embracing getting older, she said: "Have fun, laugh, make yourself laugh. Tell yourself a joke. Be silly when nobody’s watching. It’s about that time you spend with yourself."</p><p>She added: "It’s hard for me to find that space, so I now make a really big effort to enjoy it very much. Because in modern life, it’s hard. Especially if you’re married and with children. Go hide somewhere and feel it."</p><p>Though Salma only shares one biological child with François, she considers herself a mother of four, as she's a stepmother to Francois's three children from his previous relationships: François Jr. and Mathilde (whom François shares with ex-wife Dorothée Lepère) and Augustin (whom François shares with ex <a href=#>Linda Evangelista</a>).</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@salmahayek</a><p>Salma with stepson Augustin in 2021 (left); Salma with stepdaughter Mathilde in 2021 (right)</p></figure><p>Salma told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Red</a> magazine in 2017 that even though she was unable to have more biological children after Valentina (whom Salma welcomed at age 41), she was grateful for the family she had.</p><p>She said: "I always wanted to have a lot of children, and I was not able to. My body, as a miracle, had one. The huge blessing I’ve had is that my husband has three other children. So I have four. And they are all so different."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqK6tucBmn5qxlaB6rq3Rq6CenA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
