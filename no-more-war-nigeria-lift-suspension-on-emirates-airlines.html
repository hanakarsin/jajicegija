Having done so, we feel we should lift the ban on the suspension of Emirates Airlines.</p><p>“All the impediments on Emirates have been lifted and that the airline can now operate in Nigeria.”</p><p>Recall that Emirates had in February asked Nigerian travellers to conduct rapid COVID-19 tests before departure.</p><p>This travel restriction led to a ban on Emirates flights in Nigeria. The ban was later lifted after the airline agreed to stop the rapid antigen tests.</p><p>However, in March the federal government reintroduced the ban, explaining that Emirates had continued to conduct rapid antigen tests for passengers before departure from Nigeria.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5ye5FwZqenXaK8s7GMsJirZZ6etKa%2ByJpkpaGWqXq0wdKpnKermaS7brvNZpymoaKWwaa%2FjJqgq6SZo7K0ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
