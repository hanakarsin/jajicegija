As of 2020, his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">net worth is estimated</a> to be about $20 million.</p><p class=align-left>Not only does he get money from working as an actor on films, but Helms has also worked with companies such as Budweiser, Burger King, Doritos, and AT&T, among others.</p><h2>Is Ed Helms gay?</h2><p class=align-left>No, he is not. Any Ed Helms gay rumours are unfounded.</p><p class=align-left>However, he is known to support members of the LGBTQ+ community. In July 2012 Georgia-based Chick-fil-A President Dan Cathy, came out stating that his company his 'guilty as charged' when it comes accusations that the company is actively opposed to gay marriage.</p><p class=align-left>He further stated that the organization only supported 'the traditional family'. When Ed Helms found out about this, he took to Twitter to call out and boycott Chick-fil-A.</p><p class=align-left>In an effort to save face after Helms's criticism and boycott, the company, through its spokesman <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">released a statement</a> that stated in part,</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/ca6f93dcbb4a3647.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jessica Alba husband Cash Warren: Interesting facts about his parents, net worth, kids</span></p></a>From the day, Truett Cathy started Chick-fil-A, he began applying biblically-based principles to managing his business. The Chick-fil-A culture and service tradition in our restaurants is to treat every person with honour, dignity and respect ­regardless of their belief, race, creed, sexual orientation or gender. Going forward, our intent is to leave the policy debate over same-sex marriage to the government and political arena.<h2>Is Ed Helms married?</h2><p class=align-left>Yes, he is. Who is Ed Helms wife?</p><p class=align-left>The star has managed to keep his family out of the public eye. You can neither find information about when Ed Helms married her nor anything as simple detail as her name.</p><p class=align-left>The actor did, however, once speak about his wife during an interview with Jimmy Kimmel. In 2019 a tabloid had come out with a story claiming that Demi Moore was Ed Helms girlfriend.</p>I get a call from my publicist, and she says, ‘I think I know the answer to this but just double-checking, you’re not in a romantic relationship with Demi Moore, right?' I was like, ‘No, I’m happily married, I’m on vacation with my family.

Instead of her being offended, she and her mother laughed at the idea of him and Demi Moore dating.</p>I am really anxious. She is sitting there with her mother, and before I can say anything they go, ‘Demi Moore? High five! They are like, ‘Can you believe this tabloid thought you and Demi Moore could be a couple? That is insane.<h2>Does Ed Helms really sing?</h2><p class=align-left>Yes, he does. One of the most memorable moments from <i>The Hangover </i>is the Ed Helms singing scene.</p><p class=align-left>The actor wrote the famous 'Stu Song' on the set of the film, and it was added in the movie.
