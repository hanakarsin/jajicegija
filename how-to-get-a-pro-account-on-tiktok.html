Some people have managed to find a way to spend full-time-job hours creating content (and getting paid for it, too). For those power users, TikTok recommends upgrading to a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>pro account</u></a>. Luckily, it‚Äôs super easy to do. Here‚Äôs what you need to know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Here‚Äôs how to get a pro account on TikTok.</h2><p>First, let‚Äôs cover what a pro account actually is. According to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>TikTok Newsroom</u></a> leveling up to a pro account provides creators with invaluable insights that can help them become even more popular on the video-sharing app.&nbsp;</p><p>First of all, a pro account provides creators with an analytics tool to help them gain better insight into how their videos perform, as well as who engages with them. For non-pro-account users, all you really have are the bare numbers of how your videos are doing (i.e., views, shares, and comments). Users who have pro accounts get a more granular look at their statistics, with insights into weekly and monthly views, follower growth, and trending videos.</p><p>In the right hands, that kind of information can be key to taking content from being moderately popular to making it into a ton of people‚Äôs FYP. For instance, you might use the information from your pro account to determine what <a href=#><u>times are best for posting</u></a>, what topics your followers are more likely to engage with, and how people are actually finding your content.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Checking out TikTok Pro account features - Analytics etc <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/2i49lgHAFF</a></p>‚Äî Matt Navarra (@MattNavarra) <a href=#>September 16, 2019</a></figure><p>Upgrading to a pro account is actually super easy ‚Äî and, perhaps even more surprisingly, it‚Äôs totally free. All you have to do is open up the app and navigate to the Settings and Privacy tab. Choose ‚ÄúManage My Account,‚Äù then tap ‚ÄúSwitch to Pro Account.‚Äù From there, you can choose either the ‚ÄúCreator‚Äù or ‚ÄúBusiness‚Äù option (you‚Äôre most likely going to want to go with ‚ÄúCreator‚Äù).</p><p>Then you need to choose a category for your account. Options include Art, Beauty/Fashion, Education, Food/Cooking, Music/Dance, and a bunch of others. Your category won‚Äôt be publicly displayed, and it doesn‚Äôt mean that all of your videos have to stick to that one category. Just choose the one that best describes most of the content that you make.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>If you post content on TikTok....</p><p>Upgrade your account to a Pro Account!</p><p>This allows you to see analytics, including:<br>‚úÖ Prime time to upload<br>‚úÖ Follower demographic<br>‚úÖ What content has demand</p><p>Oh did I mention...</p><p>It‚Äôs completely FREE to upgrade aswell!</p><p>üé•</p>‚Äî GFUEL | Earlswood (@EarlswoodTwitch) <a href=#>May 28, 2020</a></figure><p>Finish following the directions, and you‚Äôll eventually be taken to your analytics page. Pretty simple, right? If you want to switch back to a personal account at any time, you can do so through the Settings ‚Äî but you will lose access to your analytics and to the TikTok Creator Marketplace, just FYI.</p><p>If you consider yourself to be a simple TikTok consumer, there probably isn‚Äôt any reason to upgrade to a pro account, but you totally can if you want to! On the other hand, if you‚Äôre trying to make a career out of TikTok, a pro account is definitely a must. Good luck!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby4edOoZKCdpGKubrzRqGSam5Okwq%2FAjKilZqyZoMGwtw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
