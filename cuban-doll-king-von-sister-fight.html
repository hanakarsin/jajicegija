After reaching a million followers on Instagram, she began to release rap singles. She was one of the women involved in the trending fight.

She claimed that her brother told her this before his passing. It's unclear if there were other factors that contributed to their beef online, or if their issues simply escalated because of their respective subtweets.</p><p>Leading up to their physical interaction, Kayla tweeted a phone number that she said belonged to Cuban Doll. She asked her followers to message the number to make the musician aware of her interest in fighting her. She also began using #FightKayla, and she wanted it to trend to help get the artist to agree to brawl.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>In the later evening hours of Jan. 13, Cuban Doll and Kayla did meet up in downtown Atlanta. Their fight was filmed, and snippets of it began circulating. The video has since gone viral online.</p><p>The footage showed that fists were thrown, hair was pulled, and that each woman obtained scratch marks. Kayla later said that she messed up Cuban Doll's face, so the music star later took to Instagram Live to show her injuries.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Both Kayla B and Cuban Doll claimed to be the winners of the fight.</h2><p>Following their altercation, Cuban Doll retweeted a series of posts that named her as the winner of the fight.
