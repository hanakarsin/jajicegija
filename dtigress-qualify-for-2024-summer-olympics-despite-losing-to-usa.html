As expected, it was a very one-sided encounter that ended in a humiliating 100-46 defeat for the D’Tigress.</p><p>Things turned around for the Nigerian team when Senegal also failed to defeat Belgium. Hence, Senegal’s second successive defeat in the qualification series gifted the D’Tigress a direct ticket to the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris.</p><p>This means that their last qualification game against Belgium at 5:45 p.m. on Sunday is inconsequential as the Nigerian side has already booked themselves a place in the Olympics.</p><p>This will make it the third time the Nigerian women’s basketball team will be playing in the Olympics. They participated in the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens and the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo.</p><p>Note that the 2024 Summer Olympics will take place in Paris, France, from July 26 to August 11.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ze5BpZp2smZy%2Fpr%2FSZqiumZyes7p5xaipZmpgZ4Fuv9SmpJ6qXaS5urnPopqsZZSawLG1055kpaejnruoedOoZK6rkWQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
