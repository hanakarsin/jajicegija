The insurgents who were said to have rode on motorcycles and a truck, stormed the EYN Church (Church of Brethren, Nigeria) at about 9.30am and opened fire on the members, killing 9 people and leaving many with injuries."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

As we were holding our service on Sunday, we started hearing gunshots and everybody fled. Some jumped through the windows and ran into the bushes. Some who live close to the church managed to run to their homes</i>."</p><p>According to an unnamed police source, who confirmed the killings to journalists, the villagers and their neighbours from Agapalwa then mobilised and went after the insurgents, killing about 37 of them in a reprisal attack while they arrested three of them.</p><p>Also confirming the incident, the Chairman of the Christians Association of Nigeria in the state, Rev. Titus Pona said, he was told by his members that 37 of the insurgents were killed in the reprisal attack.</p><p>It was gathered that the Sunday attack, was a revenge attack by the Boko Haram gunmen who were angered by the arrest of some of their members the previous day in Gwoza town.</p><p>Attempts to get official confirmation from police and military authorities proved abortive as the mobile telephone lines of their spokesmen were unavailable.</p><p>However, a security source at the Department of the State Security, SSS, confirmed the incident off the record to journalist.</p><p>“<i>Gwoza is boiling presently because the incident is taking a dimension that may spark religious strife amongst the Muslim-Christian community in the Gwoza neighborhood</i>”, said the security source.</p><p>Despite troops of military men and emergency rule in the state, Boko Haram have continued to attack various Borno communities, from <a href=#><u>kidnapping over 200 Government school girls in Chibok on April 14</u></a>, to <u>killing over 300 people in an attack on May 7</u> and displacing countless others from their home in different attacks.</p><p>Infuriated by the incessant attacks on their community, some <a href=#><u>women in Attagara and Kawuri villages in Gwoza and Bama Local Government areas of Borno State, on May 26, Monday</u></a> were said to have repelled attacks on their community the dreaded insurgents who had stormed the village on motorcycles.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkg3iAlmlloaydoQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
