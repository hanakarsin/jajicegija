Pereira is the only fighter to have defeated the Nigerian, and he did it in a rematch in 2018.</p><p>Adesanya saw and observed Floyd Mayweather’s concentration during his bout with Manny Pacquiao, when the unbeaten boxing superstar said he was only focused on that particular fight.</p><p>The Stylebender, while speaking via his Youtube channel, said, “I was watching Claressa Shields and Floyd Mayweather talk on FaceTime when he fought Pacquiao.</p><p>“He said he got up from the seat for every round. He always just thought like, ‘Forget every other fight. If there’s ever a fight I have to win, it’s this one.</p><p>“I feel that. That’s me right now. If there’s ever a fight, I have to win. It’s this one. That’s why everything is different in this camp. There are no excuses. If there’s ever a fight I have to win, it’s this one.”</p><p>Adesanya has never lost a fight at 185lb, and his only MMA defeat came against Jan Blachowicz at light heavyweight while he was attempting to win two titles simultaneously.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ye49uZq6ek2KupbHSmrCapl2pvG6xzK6jmqyVYrqixdaemK2glad6orTEmptmp5Zivaa%2BxKKpmmWToa60tI4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
