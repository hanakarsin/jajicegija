The final episode of Season 3 ended on a big cliff-hanger because the showrunners were not expecting the series to be canceled. And fans were not happy.&nbsp;</p><p>Soon, #SaveLucifer became a No. 1 trending topic worldwide on Twitter, with fans using the hashtag to plead for new episodes of the series. It wasn't long until a second hashtag, #PickUpLucifer, started to trend, too. There was also an online petition asking for more episodes.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Good night to Deckerstar only<a href=#>#SaveLucifer</a> <a href=#>#PickUpLucifer</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/EQxi2ds6BZ</a></p>— bella || watch lucifer on netflix (@thedetectivee) <a href=#>May 31, 2018</a></figure><p>All the work from fans did something, because on June 15, 2018, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Netflix announced</a> they had picked up the series for a fourth season.
