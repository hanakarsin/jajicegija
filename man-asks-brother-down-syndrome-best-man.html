They're brothers and they're best friends, so it was only natural that Will ask Henry, who has Down syndrome, to be his best man. But Will couldn't quite predict just how excited Henry would be to be asked.</p><p>In a heartwarming video that went totally viral, Will, who's 24, set up a secret message in a bottle that Henry, 22, could find with a metal detector asking him to be his best man. Searching for treasure is one of their favorite activities. Although Henry is a little confused about what's going on at first, you can see the joy in his eyes when he realizes what's going on.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>In a World with much need for love and positivity, <a href=#>@ClaussenHenry</a> always comes through ❤️</p><p>The note reads:</p><p>“Henry Joe, you are already the BEST bro, and my very BEST frand, so will you please say yes and be my BEST man?” <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/8QzHkh4J3D</a></p>— Will Claussen (@KeepItClaussy) <a href=#>August 16, 2020</a></figure><p>Will's fiancée films the whole thing. At first, when Henry digs and finds the bottle, he's suspicious. "Will, did you put it in here?" he asks. But Will denies everything, and helps him open up the message.</p><p>Henry reads, "Henry Joe, you are already the BEST bro, and my very BEST frand, so will you please say yes and be my BEST man?" Henry looks shocked and asks, "What?!"</p><p>Will asks him directly: "You want to be my best man?" That's when Henry leaps into his arms for the best brother bear hug ever.

It's impossible.</p><p>The video has been viewed tens of thousands of times on Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Will told In the Know</a> that the response to the video has been "absolutely nuts."

We are grateful."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>Will said that the idea for the video was almost how he proposed to his fiancée. But since that didn't work out, he used the plan to ask Henry to be his best man, and it worked great.
