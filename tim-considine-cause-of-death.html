Known early on for playing Spin Evans on The Adventures of Spin and Marty, a 1955 Mickey Mouse Club special, Tim quickly established a name for himself as a young actor.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>His next big role came by way of the hit television show Hardy Boys, in which he played one of the lead roles: amateur detective Frank Hardy.</p><p>By the time he was 19, Tim landed yet another huge television acting gig, this time on the show My Three Sons, where he played Mike Douglas. The show about three sons being raised by their widowed father was a smash hit, and Tim stayed on the program for roughly five years.</p><p>After those jobs, Tim leveraged his television fame into acting on the silver screen, taking roles in films such as the critically acclaimed Patton in 1970. When he wasn't acting, Tim was a writer for NBC, a published author, and a guest contributor for The New York Times magazine.</p><p>Our thoughts are with Tim's family, friends, and fans during this difficult time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbauecKopayhlJ67pnnCmqysnV2ks26wxJqroQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
