The process of getting the names started from the grassroots. This governor will not appoint people all by himself,” he said.</p><p>“He prefers that the people should nominate those that they feel should run the affairs of the state.</p><p>“I am sure the best hand will be nominated by the people to serve their interest in the belief that together we will take Edo State to a great height,” Shaibu added.</p><p>On of Fathers Day celebration, the deputy governor said, “Today (Sunday) reminds us that as fathers we should play our role not only in our homes but in our workplace and the society.</p><p>“As a country, the president is the father of the nation. The 36 state governors are fathers of the 36 states and they should act as fathers to the country and to their states, and when that is done, prosperity will abound.</p><p>“Chief executives of companies should act as fathers in their various establishments. Those who find themselves in various positions of authority should also see themselves as fathers. With this, Nigeria will be a better place. We should amplify those things that unite us and make positive statements at all times.</p><p>“For all fathers, we should play our roles at home just like Joseph did to protect Mary and little Jesus when he was born.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH13e5FpZp6cn2LEqcWMqJmaq5Wgtm6yzqukZqCZqHqkrcGipZ6sXaW1qrjIqWSsoJGer7Z7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
