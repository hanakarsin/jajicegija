Dr. Rob Griffith enters a coma, after which he awakens fully intending to resume his duties as the head of cardiothoracic surgery. But it's time for his gifted daughter to take the lead, and what ensues on screen is a head-to-head battle over the politics of daughter managing father, as well as, naturally, the weekly patient cases that the heart surgeons must tackle together.</p><p>Sophia, who considers it an "honor" to play a surgeon on screen, also had ambitions of becoming a doctor before she shifted lanes into the acting world. One of the actress's goals growing up was to "go to medical school and become a heart surgeon," though she fell in love with theater after doing plays. "I told my parents, much to their dismay, my senior year in high school that I wasn't going to go to medical school, I was going to get a BFA," she said, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ET Online</a>.</p><p>The actress went on to star in nearly every episode of One Tree Hill (with the exception of the pilot) as Brooke Davis, and even married her co-star Chad Michael Murray from 2005 to 2006. It's safe to say that the WB/CW drama series holds a special place in her heart and was a turning point for the actress's career.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Always+Forever.
