I don’t think because he is a governor there, he has control and monopoly over the peoples of Rivers.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH15e5FuZpuqlZa4qrrGZq6io5VirrW1yq5ksJmio8BuuMCmoJ2nXZeuo63NoKCdmV2kwamx0WannahdobKisMSrqmaZl5a2r7%2FTZpuirpmotrexjKyrmqyVorKvwNJmmaWZnZrAbq3PnGSfp6JivaK%2B07JknKqZqLa0ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
