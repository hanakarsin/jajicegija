But you should also understand the context in which events are unfolding. As we speak our director, litigation and prosecution is in court,” the INEC chairman said.</p><p>“There is a case in court. We have been invited to state our own side of the story. We usually refrain from talking about such issues because there are essentially subjudice. But we are already started talking about what alternatives are available to us in case we need to change the arrangement for the handling of sensitive materials.</p><p>“We have started thinking about it. We are aware of the situation. We will watch the situation. We still have 9 months before the next general elections. Things may be addressed out before then.</p><p>“I want to assure you that we will not jeopardize the conduct of the election by creating a misconception around the situation in the process.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH12e5BsZp6llZu2prjEZqCnnZNiuqLFjKucpaeTlsGmedKepayhpJ7DpnnMmqueqpmWubR5xaumpmWTl7tw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
