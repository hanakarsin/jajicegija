The Napoli forward hasn’t been able to play for Napoli since he scored against Fiorentina on October 8 due to the injury he sustained during Nigeria’s 2-2 draw with Saudi Arabia in October.
After spending roughly a week in Nigeria, he is set to make his way back to the Italian champions today, November 8."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He will not, however, play against Union Berlin in the UEFA Champions League at 9 p.m. later tonight.</p><p>Coach Peseiro has also ruled out Osimhen from the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers against Zimbabwe and Lesotho scheduled for this month.</p><p>Recall that Victor Osimhen came in at number eight in this year’s Ballon d’Or rankings, which Lionel Messi won. He is also <a href=# rel=noopener>a contender for the 2023 CAF Player of the Year award</a>, due to his outstanding performance last season.</p><p>The Super Eagles coach believes Osimhen has what it takes to continue his momentum after a successful season with Napoli last term, despite the recent issues that have surrounded him at the club.</p><p>“Ballon d’Or? To have come eighth in the world and first in Africa in this voting is extraordinary,” Peseiro told Sportitalia, via Il Mattino.</p><p>“He is not happy, because obviously he had an injury, which is not good news for us, for Napoli, and the Italian championship. They have not been simple weeks, the rumours about the signed contract, the transfer market issues, and the issue of the TikTok video, especially for an important player like him.</p><p>“Now, however, I know that he has a great desire to return to the pitch as soon as possible. For his abilities, for what he has demonstrated, he has and will always have the best clubs in the world who will want him.”</p><p>Victor Osimhen, who has six goals in eight games for Napoli this season, will undergo more testing when he arrives in Naples so that his recuperation can be assessed. He is expected to return to the pitch before the end of this month.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH5ye49xZqytoJq%2FbrHAoKOeq12YvKKvx2aqmrGjYsOqr9OoqWano566qbHNZqCsZZ6kwW60wKmnsmc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
