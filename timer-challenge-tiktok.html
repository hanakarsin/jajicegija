Essentially, the "Timer Challenge" is when a user sets up a timer on their phone alongside a caption such as "let's see who cares." The timer is being used in a fictional sense to represent how much time the user posting it says they have left to live.</p><p>It seems as though the goal of the "Timer Challenge" is to get people to reach out and show how and why they care about you before something bad happens. While compliments are nice, creating a video discussing suicide in any regard on TikTok is not only wrong and triggering to some, but completely against the app's content rules.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How to report "Timer Challenge" videos on TikTok.</h2><p>We all want TikTok to be a safe space for everyone to scroll through, and posting videos discussing sensitive topics such as the "Timer Challenge" is anything but that. Luckily, TikTok makes it fairly easy for users to report content, like "Timer Challenge" videos, that they feel is in violation of the platform's rules.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>If you scroll across a "Timer Challenge" video, try not to watch it and immediately click on the white arrow on the right hand side of the screen. Then tap the icon that says "report" with a small flag symbol and select the option "suicide, self-harm and dangerous acts" as the reasoning to report the content.</p><p>If you want to go a step further and report the account that made the video, simply go to their profile, click the three dots on the top right of the screen, and select "Report" to report the account.</p><p>Be advised that you shouldn't open any messages from anyone pertaining to this challenge either, as they may contain sensitive messages or videos.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbausdFmmqGZnKGyr7PEZquio6SkuA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
