proportion by some people, pointing out that everything remains under control.</p><p>The BoT chairman explained that after their own meeting on Wednesday, they will meet with Wike and other aggrieved members so the PDP can go into the 2023 elections united and ready to win.</p><p>Delta State Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa has watered down the administrative experience of Labour Party presidential candidate, Peter Obi, saying he can’t lead Nigeria at the moment.</p><p>Okowa who is the vice presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) said Obi’s only experience is as a former Governor in Anambra State is not enough to lead Nigeria.</p><p>He stressed that leading a country like Nigeria is hard and hence someone like Obi needed more to occupy the seat of the

Governor el-Rufai that the president was not aware, that singular act is enough for the NSA to be booted out.</p><p>“A country is bleeding and you will tell me that as the helmsman to strategise how our security should be functioning, you are not aware of this and the president cannot be informed. It is self-indicting.”</p><p>He further stated that Monguno should have resigned over the rise in insecurity and for not acting on intelligence reports.</p><p>The Labour Party has claimed that its presidential candidate, Peter Obi, is been supported by more than five state governors and other national leaders.</p><p>The Deputy National Chairman of the party, Bashiru Apapa, stated this during a sensitisation programme for party members at the weekend in Ado Ekiti, the Ekiti State capital.</p><p>Apapa, however, said the party will not disclose the names of the governors supporting the former Anambra State Governor.</p><p>He claimed that the governors and leaders are supporting Obi and the party because of its popularity, adding that Obi’s presidential bid was daily receiving wide support across the country.</p><p>Apapa maintained that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) are afraid of Obi’s recent popularity.</p><p>The northern leadership of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has condemned President Muhammadu Buhari’s performance in tackling insecurity.</p><p>Speaking on Sunday in Kaduna, the secretary-general of the association in the 19 northern states and the FCT, Sunday Oibe, charged the President to live up to his constitutional responsibility by protecting Nigerians and defending the sovereignty of the country, Naija News reports</p><p>The association revealed that they were worried about the security crisis in the country.</p><p>Oibe urged Buhari and the national assembly to stop living in denial, insisting that nowhere is safe in Nigeria.</p><p>He insisted that necessary measures have to be put in place to stop the activities of terrorists and other criminal elements across the country.</p><p>The presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and former Vice President of Nigeria, Atiku Abubakar on Monday met with a delegation of the British High Commission, led by the High Commissioner, Catriona Laing.</p><p>The meeting held at Atiku’s residence in Abuja, Naija News reports.</p><p>During the meeting, Atiku asked for increased collaboration between the government of the United Kingdom and Nigeria in finding solutions to issues that are of mutual benefit to both countries.</p><p>Also, they discussed a wide range of issues bordering on security, education, agriculture, economy and fostering national unity in Nigeria.</p><p>Atiku asked the UK government to play its role in ensuring the 2023 election in Nigeria is free and fair while stressing the importance of democracy’s growth in the country.</p><h2><strong>Those are the top Nigerian newspaper headlines for today.
