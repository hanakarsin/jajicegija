Source: Getty ImagesBased on recent Google searches, it seems some Olympics fans are curious to know if Nathan Chen is Mormon. That question is understandable: Nathan hails from Salt Lake City, a Utah metropolis that was founded by Mormon pioneers and a place that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints still calls home."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

You see that every single day, you’re like, ‘Dang, it’s really cool to be an Olympian.’”</p><p>He went on: “So I think being able to grow up like that — and then recognize how cool the Olympics were — just gave me the excitement and inspiration to want to chase those dreams myself.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Nathan also studied ballet at Salt Lake City’s Ballet West Academy, giving him a “competitive edge” in his skating.</h2><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><p>As Nathan grew up in Salt Lake City, he studied figure skating, gymnastics, and hockey, and he also studied ballet for six years at the Ballet West Academy. “My training and ballet background definitely gives me the competitive edge on the ice,” he said in a 2017 interview, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Salt Lake Tribune</a>.</p><p>“He had such mastery of his body,” Peter Christie, Ballet West’s former academy director, told the Tribune. “You’d have kids backstage who wanted to goof around,” Christie said, “and he was watching, analyzing, watching performances and focusing on what’s happening.”</p><p>Christie also said it was “not at all surprising” that his former student made it to the Olympics. “In our vocabulary, it was, ‘When you’re at the Olympics.’ We saw all the evidence going into competitions and him winning everything.”</p><p><a href=#>Nathan Chen and Amber Glenn Were Once a Figure-Skating Power Couple</a></p><p><a href=#>Nathan Chen Is a Talented Figure Skater –– Who Are His Parents and Siblings?</a></p><p><a href=#>Olympic Figure Skater Ashley Cain-Gribble’s Husband Gave a “Truly Incredible” Proposal</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBuusCtn5qmXZi1prqMpqarpZ%2Bj</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
