"The last five years on Superstore have been some of the most rewarding, enriching and enjoyable years of my career," she wrote in an Instagram post announcing her departure.</p><p>America also recently produced Netflix's <a href=#>Gentefied</a>, and said she wishes "only the best" for her "beloved Superstore family" as she embarks on "the next chapter for my family and career."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: nbc</span></figure><p>The series' fifth season was set to conclude on April 16, but in light of the coronavirus pandemic, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vulture</a> reports that "a finale will not be shot." Instead, April 9's Episode 21, titled "California Part 1," will close out this season.</p><p>The actress said in an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram story</a> on Friday, March 13 that it was "unexpectedly my last day shooting on Superstore this season." America added that the show was "shutting down production, as they are all shows on the Universal lot."</p><p>In the same Instagram story, the star teased that she might be returning next season after all, in order to give Amy the farewell she deserves. "I assume [this] means we'll be coming back when things clear up to finish Amy's storyline," she said. "But I'm about to shoot my last scene [of Season 5] ... right now."&nbsp;</p><p>We hope that America is taking care of herself and her rapidly growing family during this difficult time.</p><p>New episodes of Superstore air Thursdays at 8 p.m. on NBC. "California Part 1," which will serve as this season's finale, airs April 9.</p><p><strong>The best way to prevent contracting or spreading coronavirus is with </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>thorough hand washing</strong></a><strong> and </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>social distancing</strong></a><strong>.
