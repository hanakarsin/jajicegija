Chief David Nweze Umah FNSE, FNATE (Akubaraoha).</p><p>“It is obvious that having been handed an assignment under a complex party fractionalisation and well beyond his capacity, all Ali could dream of is to throw stones at the governor who is busy delivering on his mandates of taking Ebonyi to greater heights. We trust that this visionless and baseless allegation is his only strategy to convince his new paymaster that he is worthy of his hire.</p><p>“It is crystal clear that PDP in South East has bestowed their leadership on a clown and sadistic personality. For the avoidance of doubt, the content of the publication is nothing but a concoction of fabricated mendacities which is not unexpected of a man bereaved of ideas of programmes expected to emanate from the position he claims to occupy.</p><p>“We urge members of the public to disregard and discountenance the publication of Ali Odefa as a product of a misfit and social deviant whose emergence has further diminished the acceptability of PDP in the Zone.</p><p>“Those that put him in this exalted position as South East PDP Chairman for whatever motive must know the principle of life which says that” you cannot give what you do not have and where the brain is unoccupied with ideas, it is pre-occupied with valueless negative indulgences as is the case with Ali Odefa.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH10e49yZq6lkZ22brzLqKutoZ6cerW7jKmjmqakYq%2BwucFmpqdlnZp6sbDPZpqhoZWbwaK1zWg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
