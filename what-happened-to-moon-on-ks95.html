He was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2005, but continued working for more than a decade following the diagnosis.</p><p>Moon's career in radio spanned a total of 45 years, and he spent the last 17 of them with KS95. Before coming to the Twin Cities, he worked in Nebraska, Las Vegas, and Houston.</p><p>Following the announcement of his death, KS95 has been paying tribute to Moon and his career both on the air and by sharing stories about him on social media.</p><p>"His positive, energetic, often crazy, caring personality was evident to everyone around him. He loved radio, making people laugh, and getting to know KS95 listeners," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">KS95's official tribute</a> to Moon reads.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">What was Moon's cause of death?</h2><p>Moon's ultimate cause of death was multiple sclerosis, and he reportedly died in his sleep. According to KS95's tribute to him, he spent much of his life after his diagnosis advocating on behalf of those with MS.</p><p>"Moon always used his voice to raise awareness and money to fight multiple sclerosis. It’s time for one more miracle," they said. "Moon’s Miracle Fund to Fight MS will benefit the MS Society of Minnesota. There’s no better way to remember Moon than by donating to this important cause."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Hutch - KS95 (@hutchks95)</a></p></figure><p>Hutch, who replaced Moon on the show after he departed in 2019, posted a lengthy statement following the news of his death. In his post, he wrote about the ways that Moon made him want to be better.</p><p>“We truly lost and have said one final goodbye to a legend,” the post continued.</p><p>Hutch also said that much of his professional success and skill could be traced back to the role Moon had played in his life. Based on the tributes to him from KS95 and his former colleagues, it's clear that Moon made an incredible impact on everyone he touched in his career.</p><p>At the same time, many listeners weighed in to offer their own thoughts about what Moon had done for them through his years on the air. He may not have known every one of his listeners personally, but they felt like they knew him, and that ultimately helped him reach a massive audience over the course of his decades in radio.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSmp5%2BjerC6jKSqcm0%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
