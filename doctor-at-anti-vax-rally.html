Vaccinations have become a very hot button topic for people over the years.  There are arguments for both sides, as autism has become more prevalent in society and has been linked to certain vaccinations.  The other side is, of course, actually getting the disease that the vaccine is for, which could be deadly."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

That's short of the 95 percent rate recommended for herd immunity, which is the ideal rate of immunization to protect those who can't receive vaccinations for medical reasons.&nbsp;</p><p>This low rate of immunization has caused several states to adopt a "No Jab, No Play" policy, requiring that children be immunized before they can enroll in childcare or access government benefits.</p><p>One reason some parents are not immunizing their children is the now debunked claim that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">vaccinations cause autism</a>. They don't. In fact, vaccinations save millions of lives around the globe every year, and were essential in wiping out terrible diseases, like polio.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite these facts, thousands of vaccine skeptics across Australia participated in protests late last month <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">claiming that the policy</a> "discriminates against families for making a free and legal decision."&nbsp;</p><p>One of these protests took place in Melbourne, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTuber Lewis Spears</a> decided to attend to see if he could find a single doctor or medical professional among them. Guess how many he found. &nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><p>That's a lot of misinformation, if you ask me.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKyimrultc2gZmtoYWx8cYKOa2lof519g6l7w6iaraeiYq61ecCnq6JlppbFbr7ApaOy</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
