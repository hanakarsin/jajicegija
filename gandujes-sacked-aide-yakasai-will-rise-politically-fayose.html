Not a single day goes by without some sort of insecurity in this land. This is a shame! Deal with terrorists decisively or resign.”</p><p>The Commissioner for Information in the state, Muhammad Garba, however, announced his sacking.</p><p>The statement said Yakasai was sacked “over his continued unguarded comments and utterances which are deemed contrary to the stand of the All Progressive Congress government which he is serving”.</p><p>“The aide had failed to differentiate between personal opinion and official stand on matters of public concern and therefore cannot be allowed to continue to serve in a government he does not believe,” the statement added.</p><p>Reacting to the news, Fayose said Yakasai’s ability to speak truth to power has made him a hero of democracy.</p><p>“I commend the courage of Salihu Yakasai, the sacked Gov Ganduje’s Aide for being able to speak truth to power. This singular action of his has made him the latest hero of our democracy, and in turn, confirmed that there is hope for a united Nigeria.”</p><p>“Nothing can be more honourable than what he has done by standing tall amidst darkness & selfishness of leadership. His sack is the beginning of his rise politically. I sincerely congratulate him & indeed the ordinary Nigerians seeking good governance & leadership.#BuhariMustResign,” he wrote on Twitter.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH1ze5FwZqCZnpnCq7HSZqqam5uasW6tyJ2cZrGRoK60rchmrqKknGK%2Fqr%2FEZqeopJmptqSty6WwZp6Rrry0sY4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
