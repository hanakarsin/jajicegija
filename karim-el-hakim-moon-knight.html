Murray Abraham.</a> However, the actor who plays Khonshu on screen is Karim El Hakim. Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CMSImpact</a>, Karim is an award-winning cinematographer and director who has contributed to multiple documentaries. He also played the character Louis in the Netflix series Paranormal.</p><p>Karim was the cinematographer for 1/2 Revolution, a documentary about the 2011 Egyptian revolution that garnered multiple award nominations, including a nomination for the Sundance Film Festival Grand Jury Prize. Another short film Karim served as the cinematographer for was Beit Min Lahm: House of Flesh.</p><p>Some of Karim's other work includes the documentary Free Trip to Egypt, and the 2021 award-winning documentary As I Want.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Karim El Hakim (@ka_ra_im)</a></p></figure><p>Karim explained the power of the camera to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sundance</a> when speaking about his work on 1/2 Revolution. "A camera is perhaps the only weapon people have against countering the sheer brutality and impunity of a police state," he said. "But it also takes an international audience that is willing and able to listen, and able to act on its collective outrage, that is the real driving force for influencing change."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Will Karim appear in the last four episodes of 'Moon Knight'?</h2><p>Although there's no official confirmation on whether Karim will appear in the last four episodes of Moon Knight, it's highly likely. Khonshu has appeared in Episodes 1 and 2, never too far away from Steven. Now that Marc has taken over, Khonshu has sent him to an undisclosed location in Egypt, so we definitely haven't seen the last of the mysterious Egyptian moon god.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Karim El Hakim (@ka_ra_im)</a></p></figure><p>Karim certainly does a great job of making Khonshu an imposing presence! Make sure not to miss out on Marc Spector's journey with Khonshu in Moon Knight.
