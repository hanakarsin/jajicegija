While her introduction to Zach was pretty straightforward, it seems she made enough of an impression during the time they did spend together to earn an early one-on-one. According to her official bio, Aly is looking for commitment.</p><p>“With a beautiful smile and a personality to match, Aly is a Southern sweetheart ready to find love!" the bio explains.</p><p>"Aly is a hopeless romantic and has even ended serious relationships because her exes weren’t ready for the real deal. She’s the full package and is as passionate about her work in healthcare as she is about Disneyland. Aly hopes Zach can match her energy and is excited to meet a man who’s ready for marriage," the bio continues, before discussing Aly's golden doodle, which is named Texas.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>So surreal seeing someone I know irl on this show!

Ordinarily, contestants who cause drama find a way to stick around for a little bit longer, especially since Christina met Zach's entire family on their one-on-one date last week.</p><p>It seems like Zach is not really here for all of that, though. Instead, he's focused on finding a person to spend the rest of this life with, whether that person turns out to be Aly or someone else. Those who want to know what happens will have to tune in to know for sure.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflrm6ecmamqiao2LBqbGMm5icoJWhvLM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
