This decision might not be unconnected with the fact that the church organized a lavish 60th birthday party for the pastor’s wife, Dr. Siju Iluyomade, barely a week after the tragic death of Wigwe, his wife, and their first son in a helicopter crash. Herbert Wigwe was known to be a faithful and dedicated member of the City of David parish in Victoria Island, Lagos, and had significantly contributed to the growth of the church​​​​​​.</p><p>The family’s decision not to involve the City of David Parish in the burial services, despite Wigwe’s close association with the church, reflects their dissatisfaction with the church’s actions following the tragedy. The situation has sparked discussions about the church’s sensitivity and the timing of the celebration relative to the Wigwe family’s mourning period.</p><p>THE BURIAL PROGRAMME</p><p>Celebrating Herbert Wigwe — ” A Professional Legacy”<br>Monday, March 4, 2024<br>Venue: Eko Hotel, Victoria Island, Lagos<br>Time: 2:00pm-6:00pm</p><p>Celebrating Chizi Wigwe<br>Tuesday, March 5, 2024<br>Venue: Eko Hotel, Victoria Island, Lagos<br>Time: 10:00am</p><p>Celebrating Chizoba Wigwe<br>Tuesday, March 5, 2024<br>Venue: Eko Hotel, Victoria Island, Lagos<br>Time: 5:00pm</p><p>Night of Tributes<br>Wednesday, March 6, 2024<br>Venue: Eko Hotel Victoria Island, Lagos<br>Time: 5:00pm</p><p>Combined Service of Songs<br>Thursday, March 7, 2024<br>RCCG, Resurrection Parish,<br>1 Resurrection Drive, 1st Gate,<br>Jakande Estate, Km 15 Lekki<br>Time: 10:00am</p><p>Christian Wake-Keeping<br>Friday, March 8, 2024<br>Wigwe University, Isiokpo<br>6:00pm</p><p>Combined Funeral Service<br>Saturday, March 9, 2024<br>RCCG, Lion of Judah Parish, Isiokpo<br>10:00am</p><p>Private Interment Ceremony<br>Saturday, March 9, 2024</p><p>Outing Service<br>Sunday, March 10, 2024<br>RCCG, Lion of Judah Parish, Isiokpo<br>10:00am</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ze5FxZp%2BZnZ65unnRnqOemaOawG6CjJ2YsmWSqr%2BqrctmqaKslah6p7vRZq6in6eaeri1xZ5krKeeZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
