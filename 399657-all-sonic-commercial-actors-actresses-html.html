With their in-vehicle shenanigans, the “Two Guys”; T.J. Jagodowski and Peter Grosz proved famous enough to land genuine broadcast appointment and public acknowledgement.</p><p class=align-left>However, in 2020, the food chain adopted a new strategy, incorporating a different campaign and a new cast.</p><h2>Sonic commercial actors: Out with the "old," in with the "new"</h2><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/8ff1517dfc06e3d0.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Wingstop Commercial actors and actress's names, profiles, photos</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Business cycles keep revolving, and there's no doubt that Sonic is re-directing its marketing initiatives. This has brought about the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">end </a>of the 'Sonic Guys' as the chain's brand ambassadors. But why did they get rid of the sonic guys?</p><h3>The “Two Guys” 1st termination</h3><p class=align-left>Peter and T.J. were Sonic Drive-In brand ambassadors for six years since 2004. Their marketing tactic was applauded due to the incredible impact it had on potential customers. However, six years later, the duo was relegated by the company in 2010.</p><p class=align-left>This move caught the duo unawares, but it was clear that they weren’t ready to depart from their commercial routine. They thus opted to record food ads that were all Sonic themed on YouTube. This move brought about enormous reaction online that the food chain chose to reinstate them back again in 2012.</p><h3>The 2nd termination by Sonic Drive-In</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/7d408cdf089310d8.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What happened to Scott on Counting Cars? What you need to know</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The two cronies experienced massive success in promoting the chain's fast-food menu. However, Sonic was looking at a different <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">strategy</a> in 2020. Having used a comical approach to market their food chain, the company decided to incorporate non-scripted ads where real people are featured ordering real food while having real conversations at various Sonic Drive-In locations.</p><p class=align-left>Much as the retailer ended its contract with Peter and T.J., its chief marketing officer gave a statement highlighting that the company isn’t completely abandoning the “Two Guys” campaign and will incorporate it in some way.</p><p class=align-left>The duo, however, seems to be on a mission to do new projects. Jagodowski is currently voice acting in the audio comedy <i>Escape from Virtual Island</i>, and Grosz is writing for <i>At Home with Amy Sedaris</i>.</p><h2>Sonic Drive-In marketing dynamics</h2><p class=align-left>Sonic Drive-In is among Chicago's prime food chain and has been operational since the early 1950s. It is an American drive-in fast-food restaurant chain owned by Inspire Brands, Arby's and Buffalo Wild Wings' parent company.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/6c6145e7fd8e3adf.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Lumify commercial cast: names, photos, and other TV roles</span></p></a><p class=align-left>With such a high profile, the company tries to market its products uniquely, and over the years they've been huge on advertisements and campaigns. One of the strategies they've incorporated is using influencers to sell their foods.</p><p class=align-left>Several characters have been featured in their ads over the years. Some went as far as getting multiple features due to the amazing connection they had with the audience. That said, "Who are the actors in Sonic commercials?"</p><h3>1. The “Two Guys”</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/8ff1517dfc06e3d0.jpeg><p class=align-left>Jagodowski and Grosz commonly referred to as the "Two Guys" both hail from Chicago and grew up in the city's notable comedy parody scene (through Business Diaries). They were the first campaigners for Sonic Drive-In and adopted a comic style to advertising food.</p><p class=align-left>The pair's ads were shot by <i>Barkley Advertisement </i>while highlighting their experiences eating Sonic foods. Much as their content was scripted, from time to time, they would go off-book, teasing one another, while marketing the Oklahoma-based fast-food chain.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/39b1cc815b10a133.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>DirecTV commercial cast: actors and actresses names, photos, other roles</span></p></a><h3>2. Melanie Paxson</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/7d408cdf089310d8.jpeg><p class=align-left>Many people have been questioning, "Who is the actress in the sonic commercial?" Melanie is one of the new faces of Sonic campaigns. She’s also from Chicago and is famous for her mouse-like voice, which has made her popular in the Red Robin commercials.</p><p class=align-left>In addition to being the face of Red Robin, Melanie Paxson is also the “voice of reason” in Gladware ads, and has also done commercials for DayQuil. She acts alongside the kid with glasses in the Sonic commercial who brings out the element of a stubborn lad who wants to eat whatever he likes. Melanie Paxson <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">net worth</a> is $600,000 from her commercial appearances.</p><h3>3. Taylor Red</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/6c6145e7fd8e3adf.jpeg><p class=align-left>Taylor Red is one of the popular sonic commercial actors. She is one of the identical triplet sisters; Nika, Natalie, and Nicole. Taylor composed the girl band whose sound is best described as young, fun, and country.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/bb9901c150f614c9.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What happened to The Timepiece Gentleman? Here's what you should know</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The Sonic new campaign is centred around the tagline "This is How We Sonic," and features commercials about four different families' activities for a day. Her role in the campaign is to bring in a fresh vibe that young people want to associate with.</p><h2>Are the Sonic guys married?</h2><p class=align-left>It is unusual to come across two male friends who gel so perfectly and even survived working together for a decade. This aspect led many followers to ask; "Are the Sonic guys a couple?”</p><p class=align-left>Peter Grosz is not gay. He is married to Debra Downing, who compliments her husband's writing career, thus compiling very creative and funny blogs. On the other hand, T.J. Jagodowski leads a private life and very little is known about his family or personal relationships.</p><h2>What is the Sonic commercial guys' salary?</h2><p class=align-left>Commercial ads are a door to endless opportunities both financially and creating a name for yourself. This is an attest to the Sonic commercial actors. Peter Grosz has a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">net worth</a> of $1.5 million. T.J. Jagodowski <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">net worth</a> is $600,000.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/3b1a8208de2f4f31.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>EarthGang members: names, profiles, net worth, songs, albums</span></p></a><p class=align-left>T.J and Peter may no longer be Sonic commercial actors, but they served a fantastic tenure to the fast chain. They have made a name for themselves, and their commercials are worth the watch. With the amazing talent that each character portrays, you can expect more amazing content from them in other projects.</p><p class=align-left><a id=https://www.tuko.co.ke/ href=#>Tuko.co.ke</a> published an article about the <a href=#>State Farm Commercial</a> actors. The characters are hilarious and make acting look easy by bringing out a different side of marketing an insurance company. From amazing actors like Alfonso Ribeiro from The Fresh Prince of Bela-Air, you can expect nothing short of a rib-cracking special.</p><p class=align-left>Who is the cast?
