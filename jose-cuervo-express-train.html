Source: Jose CuervoAs you may or may not know, Dia De Los Muertos (or Day of the Dead) is coming up. If you don't know much about it, Day of the Dead is an important holiday largely celebrated in Mexico, which — from the outside — may seem somewhat similar to Halloween, but in reality, it couldn't be more different."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

If you don't know much about it, Day of the Dead is an important holiday largely celebrated in Mexico, which — from the outside — may seem somewhat similar to Halloween, but in reality, it couldn't be more different.&nbsp;</p><p>Starting Oct. 31 through Nov. 2, the living will reconnect with friends and family who have passed away by dressing up, participating in processions, and bringing offerings and food to cemeteries.</p><p>And if you're looking to learn more about the pivotal Mexican holiday, and experience it authentically while sipping some damn delicious tequila, I strongly suggest hopping aboard <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the José Cuervo Express train</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>It's going to be touring through the town of Tequila in Jalisco, Mexico during the holiday, which is bound to give guests a truly authentic Dia De Los Muertos experience.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Guests will get the chance to see how locals celebrate Day of the Dead.</h2><p>Like the annual holiday, Jose Cuervo's Day of the Dead Tequila Train lasts a total of two days, per Delish.&nbsp;On Friday, Nov. 1, guests will get the opportunity to participate in authentic <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Day of the Dead celebrations</a>, right in the town of Tequila.&nbsp;</p><p>There, you will be able to partake in processions and altar lightings, while listing to live music and local stories. And meanwhile, you'll obviously be sipping local tequila.&nbsp;</p><p>The following day on Saturday, Nov. 2, guests will be able to<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> visit the local agave fields</a> where tequila is harvested, according to Delish, as well as La Rojeña Distillery, tequila tastings will be held.&nbsp;</p><p>From there, the train will embark on a scenic trip to the city of Guadalajara, for a special selection of Day of the Dead activities.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>To book your spot on the tequila train, navigate to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mundo Cuervo website</a> to book transportation and any additional excursions for the weekend of Nov. 1.&nbsp;</p><p>The cost of the train, the outings to the agave fields and distillery will come out to $107 per person, and that's pretty reasonable, if you ask me.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">If you do decide to go, don't forget to be respectful!</h2><p>The Houston Press couldn't have said it better: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Day of the Dead is not Halloween</a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">: Part Two,</a> and locals will be mourning and reconnecting with loved ones who have passed.&nbsp;</p><p>So go and have a good time — just don't treat it like a frat party! It's a cultural experience that means a lot to locals who are actually celebrating, so don't ruin it for them.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">If you can't make it on the express train, however, Jose Cuervo is offering limited-edition Day of the Dead bottles.&nbsp;</h2><p>Yes, you heard that loud and clear, friends — the brand is offering <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cuervo Tradicional Plata</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cuervo Tradicional Reposado</a> bottles this year, which both feature traditional calaveras designs, including the brightly colored sugar skulls, as well as marigold flowers.</p><p>Make sure to order them via Reserve Bar before the holiday is over — they're bound to brighten any bar cart or ofrenda.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Courtesy of Jose Cuervo</span></figure><p>Jose Cuervo's Tequila Train is celebrating Day of the Dead in one of the most authentic ways imaginable.
