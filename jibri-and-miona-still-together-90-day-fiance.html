With a five year age gap and the fact that they lived in two different countries (<a href=#>Serbia</a> and the U.S), there were a lot of obstacles in their way.</p><p>Nonetheless, Jibri and Miona finished out their season with a spectacular on-screen wedding. Are they still together, or has their relationship since gone south?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Are Jibri and Miona from '90 Day Fiancé' still together?

But suddenly, fans started noticing that the reality TV star deleted all photos of Jibri on her social media.</p><p>This appeared to be a major red flag and a potential sign that the couple had called it quits. To make matters more suspicious, Miona has shared that she is currently <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">enjoying herself in California</a>, while all of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jibri’s recent posts have been in Thailand</a>.</p><p>For the cherry on top, in Miona's latest posts, she has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">not been wearing the wedding ring</a> that Jibri gave her. Have they gotten a divorce or are they just going through a major argument?</p><p>The good news is that Jirbri responded to the rumors so we now know the true status of the couple's relationship.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jibri has responded to the breakup rumors.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Jibri Bell (@jibribell)</a></p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>In Oct. 2023, Jibri uploaded <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a video on Instagram</a> of himself alone without Miona by his side.

Jibri replied back with one word: "Yes."</p><p>Even though he did not elaborate on their situation and didn't provide a response about the lack of social media photos of the couple, his brief confirmation did reassure fans that perhaps the two are just going through a small disagreement — and maybe their marriage has hope to be worked on.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Miona and Jibri didn't see eye-to-eye on most things during their season.</h2><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>One of the main challenges between the reality TV couple that was featured during Season 9 was the location issue. A married couple is supposed to settle down in the same place together. However, these two couldn't quite agree on where that would be.</p><p>While Miona was getting a visa to be able to live with Jibri in America, she was disappointed that he lived in South Dakota with his family. Instead, she wanted them to live in Los Angeles.</p><p>For the short time that Miona stayed with Jibri in South Dakota, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she got into a big argument with his mother</a> Mahala over the way that she dressed. Ultimately, Jibri gave in and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">decided to move to Calif.</a> to make her happy.</p><p>Watch 90 Day Fiancé on TLC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn7ajvshmmKecXaK2sLrAZqqtoZyherW7xp6roZ2iYoZxecOasGaemZa7pLE%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
