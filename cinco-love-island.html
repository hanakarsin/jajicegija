Source: CBSAs most Love Island fans know, the reality show can bring out the worst in people. But when it comes to Melvin &#34;Cinco&#34; Holland Jr., he's in it for a good time and maybe even to find a partner worth keeping around. But as an admitted cheater, he might have some more growing to do before he can form a real connection on Love Island, even if his intentions are (mostly) pure."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

But when it comes to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Melvin "Cinco" Holland Jr.</a>, he's in it for a good time and maybe even to find a partner worth keeping around. But as an admitted cheater, he might have some more growing to do before he can form a real connection on Love Island, even if his intentions are (mostly) pure.</p><p>Still, fans are plenty curious about who he is outside of the show and what Cinco brings to the table as a potential partner for one of the women in Season 3. The point of the show is for singles to find a partner to couple up with and hopefully remain with for a chance to win the $100,000 prize. Does Cinco have what it takes to get that far?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@thetough_cinco</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Who is Melvin "Cinco" Holland Jr. on 'Love Island'?</h2><p>The Season 3 premiere introduces Cinco as the kind of man apparently all the women want because it doesn't take long for them to admit their attraction to the guy. And in real life, he has had his fair share of relationships, proving that the charm is very real, even if it has gotten him into trouble in the past.</p><p>But when he's not being a womanizer, Cinco works with the company The Tough Fitness, which he co-founded. The business is dedicated to training people from all walks of life and helping individuals on their weight loss journeys.</p><p>He also seems to have strong family values, as he has shared Instagram photos with his father, and he's still close to his fraternity brothers.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Melvin Holland Jr. (@thetough_cinco)</a></p></figure><p>And while Cinco's job on Love Island is listed as a delivery driver, he also once played football for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tennessee Tech University</a>. He also played for the University of Minnesota, so clearly, athletics, in general, are a big part of his life. And if he has the competitive mentality to match, then the other guys in the <a href=#>Love Island villa</a> might not stand much of a chance.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">There are rumors about Cinco having a girlfriend outside of 'Love Island.'</h2><p>One thing that could hurt Cinco's chances of coupling up with someone and remaining together on Love Island, however, is the chance that he already has a girlfriend back home. While there is no evidence of this on Cinco's social media and he hasn't admitted to it himself, some fans in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a> thread dedicated to Love Island claimed that Cinco was already seeing someone prior to going on the show.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span></figure><p>According to the thread, Cinco is allegedly dating someone and it's pretty serious. These Redditors also claim that Cinco went on Love Island solely for the business opportunities that might come his way because of it.</p><p>Those are some heavy accusations, but Cinco himself hasn't admitted anything. And if he falls for one of the women this season, and it's proven that he's single, then the rumors can probably be put to bed.</p><p>Watch Love Island Tuesdays-Fridays and Sundays at 9 p.m. EST on CBS.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmLavr85mo6iulWK2tLjAp5s%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
