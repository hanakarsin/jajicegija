He went there because the chairmanship of the party was zoned to the south.</p><p>“If southern governors have taken a decision that they desire the presidency to come from the South he should have known that there is no point trying to rock the boat by kicking and running for a second term.”</p><p>Akawor went on to allege that the embattled National Chairman of the party, Prince Uche Secondus was suspended due to his refusal to pay his dues in the last four years.</p><p>But Secondus while faulting his suspension, asserted that only the National Executive Committee (NEC) has the power to discipline him or any member of the National Working Committee (NWC).</p><p>He insisted in a statement by his media aide, <strong>Ike Abonyi</strong>, that those who purportedly suspended him acted contrary to Article 59 (3) of the PDP Constitution, which is clear on the party’s disciplinary measures.</p><p>The PDP Chairman maintained that Article 59(3) of the PDP Constitution states clearly that “only the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the party can discipline the National Chairman or any other National officer of the party.”</p><p>Secondus also called on members of the public and the media to be wary of agents who were out to distract the main opposition party from its focus of rescuing Nigeria.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH16e49sZmtoYmh6qbvWZqqem5%2Bjsba%2FjLCmq6OVmXqis8CipaysXZi8rbjEnKuirpVitq%2FAxKucrKxdpLNuv86uq6GdoqN6r7XGnqmimV2ntrex0axkqZygZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
