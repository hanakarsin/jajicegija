While avoiding spoilers — seeing as the season finale has just become available on <a href=#>Prime Video</a> — we're eager to discuss Season 5.</p><p>For starters, when can we expect Season 5 of The Boys to be released? Here's everything we currently know so far about the highly-anticipated conclusion to this hit series.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Courtesy of Prime</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">When is the release date for Season 5 of 'The Boys'?</h2><p>At the time of writing, the release date for Season 5 of The Boys is unknown. There has been a varying gap between seasons, with the first and second released a year apart, and Seasons 3 and 4 spaced two years apart.</p><p>Based on this pattern, Season 5 might see a release date in the summer or fall of 2026.</p><p><a href=#>Eric Kripke</a>, the creator and showrunner, confirmed in June 2024 to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a> that filming for the eight-episode final season would occur from mid-November 2024 to mid-2025.</p><p>He added that he had known for years that Season 5 would be the series's conclusion, a realization that came during the writing of Season 3.</p><p>"It took a minute for Amazon to agree," he explained to the outlet, mentioning that it took additional time to get the company to "clear it in all the channels so that we could finally announce it."</p><p>Now, this doesn't mean there will be a two-year break from The Boys franchise. As the fifth and final season prepares for production, fans can anticipate the release of Season 2 of the spinoff <a href=#>Gen V</a> around 2025. This second season will likely follow Season 4 of The Boys and further pave the way for the main show's climactic ending.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbWmecGosKxlo5qutLvNZmxmqpWhsqK%2FxGabmqyV</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
