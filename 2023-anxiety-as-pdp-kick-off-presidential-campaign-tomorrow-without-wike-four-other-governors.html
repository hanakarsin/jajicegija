But we cannot afford to go to the election with a divided house. If we do, it may cost us dearly.”</p><p>PDP in the last few months have been trying to resource the differences between the presidential candidate of the party, Atiku and the Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike.</p><p>The crisis has seen the camp of Governor Wike’s request for the replacement of the National Chairman of the party, Iyorchia Ayu as its demand to support Atiku in 2023.</p><p>Governor Wike’s camp in a move to press home its demand withdrew from the PDP campaign council.</p><p>PDP before their withdrawal had made the Governor of Oyo State who is in Wike’s camp as the Vice Chairman (South) for the campaign council, while Wike, Samuel Ortom (Benue State), Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi (Enugu State) and Okezie Ikpeazu (Abia State) were named as members of the campaign council.</p><p>Segun Sowunmi expressed worries as PDP kicks off its presidential campaign on Monday with a divided house.</p><p>He, however, stated that all hope is not lost as aggrieved members of the party can still join hands together ahead of the 2023 general election</p><p>Sowunmi said, “it will be interesting to see how the citizens, who are made up of more than 80 million registered voters, how they interpret what their own individual role is in terms of determining who will be the next leader of the country. So, all hope is not lost.”</p><p>A former PDP national vice chairman (South), Eddy Olafeso in a chat with The Sun called on aggrieved stakeholders in the party to bury their hatchet.</p><p>Eddy said, “we don’t have to fight each other. Enough of the ugly mess. And abuses of one another. It will not augur well for anybody to continue to fight at this moment. The only people that we need to fight is the APC that has led very backward governance and ruined virtually everything for the country.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe49yZmtoYmh6orrXopytsV2WwG68w6lkpKGToHqwssVmp6udo56xprrTopilZZOWurGtyKClZqyforyzvs6wZLChpJ28tsCMsKCknV2bvLa%2BjKiroZ2iYrSwwsSrpaiqo2Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
