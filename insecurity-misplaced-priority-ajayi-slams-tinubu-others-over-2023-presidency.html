Then we move from there to participate in the national convention, where they are going to choose the flagbearer of the party,” Ogunlewe had said.</p><p>Recall that Tinubu has now spent months in the United Kingdom recuperating from surgery. While getting himself rested in London, the APC chieftain has played host to state governors, Senators, APC Chieftains, including President Muhammadu Buhari himself, <strong>Naija News</strong> understands.</p><p>However, Ajayi has expressed concern about the ongoing gruesome killings across states by the terrorist groups.</p><p>He prayed the politicians to shift their focus on how to deal with the challenges than talking about the country’s next president.</p><p>According to him, “if politicians truly have the interest of Nigeria at heart, they would concentrate on resolving the country’s challenges.”</p><p>Ajayi said: “The issue of 2023 should not be the major focus now; the situation in Nigeria is so dire, so serious in the economy, and particularly with insecurity. This has to be the attention of our politicians if they have the country’s interest at heart.</p><p>“So, the question of who should be the president or not should not be the major focus. It could be an underground thing but what we should focus on is the issue of insecurity.</p><p>“The other day, the governor of Niger State lamented that bandits have taken over some section of the state. The Chairman of Shiroro Local Government in the same state had said his domain has not only been taken over by Boko Haram and bandits, but they now hoist their flag and forcing residents to join them.</p><p>“So to people like that, what does 2023 mean to them? It’s more important to survive and be in good condition before we now talk about who should become what.</p><p>“To me, our politicians, if they genuinely have the interest of Nigerians at heart, they should concentrate on how to bring an end to the issue of insecurity. Look at what is happening in the Southeast. Is that the kind of life we should be living? ”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5xe49wZqKmo5qwtr7IrbBmpZmova2twp6bZqiinryztdOyZJqika62br%2FLmqSsZaSeu7au1GamraCVp8Buu9WeqWZqYGeAbrzRnqqinJWjsLp7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
