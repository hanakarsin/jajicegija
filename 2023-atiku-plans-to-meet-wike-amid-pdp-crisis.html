Governor Wike is a key member of our party and we need him to be on our side, not just for the election but also because that is the right thing to do. The governor is a good party man and is not the type to jump around and once Atiku meets him, we are confident the issues would be resolved and they would be able to work together for the overall interest of the party.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH14e49sZmtoYmh6osDIpKxmqJyWu7R506hkpp2VqXq4tcqeZJqlmZl6sbDPZpqroaOewHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
