"To have a film like this, I'm hoping that it makes people feel like they're not alone, and that they can reach out and talk to someone, if they need help."</p><p>Echoing similar sentiments, Justice explained how the topics discussed in the YA film are universal. "I think that this particular film does something different, because we are telling a story about young people, but it's not necessarily within that YA genre, and it's about young people dealing with such adult things," he said.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>Adding, "So it kind of transcends what we've seen before from movies about high school, and [shows] how difficult it is to deal with these universal themes of grief and loss and love, which we all go through.
