Source: istockWhen we think of Easter, the best things to come to mind are chocolate, pastel colors, bunny-shaped everything, and of course, Easter egg hunts. Egg hunts are so fun and instill such a sense of childish wonder in anyone who participates — no matter their age or religion — that we recommend everyone do one at least once in their lives."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Egg hunts are so fun and instill such a sense of childish wonder in anyone who participates —&nbsp;no matter their age or religion — that we recommend everyone do one at least once in their lives.</p><p>Anyway, you can probably tell that we're huge fans of the activity. Such fans, in fact, that we decided to round up the best Easter egg hunts around the country, so you're sure to find an event near you.&nbsp;</p><p>Now grab your bunnies and your hunnies, and start taking notes for your Sunday plans!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Easter egg hunts near you:&nbsp;</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: istock</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Chicago</h2><p>Take your kids to the Lincoln Park Zoo for this year's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Easter Egg-Stravaganza</a> this Saturday, April 20 from 8 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. There's going to be several different waves of egg hunts for different age groups, musical acts, crafts, complimentary carousel rides and animal viewing. Starting at 1 p.m., take your photo with the Easter Bunny — and return on Easter Sunday for a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">brunch buffet</a>.</p><p>Also on Saturday is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Healing the Hood Chicago's Easter Egg Hunt</a>, an all-ages event that will see around 5,000 eggs hidden around the park awaiting to be found. 5,000?! Count us in!&nbsp;</p><p>But if you'd prefer something more unusual, hit up the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wizard of Oz Egg Hunt</a> at NewCity. They created a poppy field and an Emerald City lounge to make it feel as real as possible. Plus, you can meet Dorothy, the Tinman, the Scarecrow and the Cowardly Lion while the kids get their faces painted and you enjoy snacks.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: istock</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Houston</h2><p>Houston is offering Easter egg hunts on both Saturday and Sunday, so if you can only go out one day this weekend, don't worry about juggling too many things on your schedule.&nbsp;</p><p>Our absolute favorite event on this list is the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Czech Center Museum</a>'s Easter egg hunt on Saturday. First, you get to hunt eggs throughout the museum at noon! We can't imagine a funner way to hunt for eggs than among art, or a funner way to view art than by getting to also look for Easter eggs. Next, you get to paint eggs with an artist who's running an egg-painting workshop at the CCM. Best of all, tickets are free for kids 12 and under, and only $5 for adults.</p><p>On Sunday, we have to send you to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Adult Easter Egg Hunt</a> at the Wildcatter Saloon. It starts at 4 p.m. and promises over $2,000 in cash and prizes! Sorry, what?! One can hunt for something other than candy? Like, actual cold, hard cash? We've been doing this Easter thing all wrong.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: istock</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">New York</h2><p>If you're in the city this weekend, grab your Easter basket (but don't worry if you don't have one, they have extras) and hunt eggs for a great cause: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Big Brothers Big Sisters NYC</a>. The fun starts at noon on Saturday at Monarch Rooftop Bar on 35th Street with drinks, snacks and Easter bunny photo opps. The hunt itself begins at 1 p.m., then there's egg decorating, face painting, games and a dance party into the afternoon.</p><p>On Sunday, sign up for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">POGO's Amazing Easter Egg Scavenger Hunt</a>, which goes from 1:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. and promises to be one-of-a-kind. "A series of clues leads you around the city performing physical and mental challenges along the way," the event's copy reads. These will "lead you around NYC looking for hidden eggs worth points and prizes." The winning team takes home $100 in cash. Just make sure to sign up before Sunday, because the city-wide hunt won't happen unless they get 10 participants.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: istock</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Los Angeles</h2><p>Did someone say moon bounce? This year's annual <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rustic Canyon Easter Egg Hunt</a> promises fun, refreshments, egg hunts divided by age groups, music, crafts, games, AND MOON BOUNCES! Make sure the kids bring their own baskets or bags for this Saturday event. Arrive at 10 a.m. and plan to stay until 2 p.m.</p><p>Head downtown to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Grand Hope Park</a> on Sunday from 2 to 5 p.m. for New City Church's EasterFest AKA Festival de Pascua, which is open to everyone and promises thousands of eggs to be hunted. Plus, multiple bounce houses, piñatas, a pie-eating contest, snacks, crafts, and face-painting. Admission costs $30 per family or $6 per person, but scholarships are available for people who <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">need assistance.</a> Don't miss out on the biggest egg hunt in all of downtown!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: istock</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Philadelphia</h2><p>OK, we were impressed with Chicago's 5,000 eggs but the<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Philly Egg Hunt</a> boasts 35,000 of them! Plus, it's free! Egg hunts will be available every 10 minutes on Saturday, for kids ages 1-2, 3-4, 5-7 and 8-10. The fun starts at 10:30 a.m. in Roxborough's Gorgas Park and features inflatable slides, sack races, a petting zoo, and so much more.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Transform Philly's</strong> <strong>Easter Egg Hunt</strong></a><strong> </strong>will also be broken up into four age categories, but this one's on Sunday, in case you were unable to make the Gorgas Park event. This egg hunt is also free (thanks Philly!) and takes place at West Philadelphia High School from 11:15 to 12:30 p.m.</p><p>Happy Easter! Have so much fun hunting eggs, eating candy, and maybe even winning some money!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmq60wMSrZJ6fl2K1trrTrGSnnZGneq6xjGtnanE%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
