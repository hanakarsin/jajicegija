It beggars belief to see that a nation that is fighting an existential war against bandits and terrorists is constantly being held down by an international body which it willingly joined. Nigeria is a sovereign state and will not surrender its sovereignty to any organisation,” Lai Mohammed added.</p><p>“ICC, Amnesty International and their cohorts should desist from threatening our troops and putting the security of our country in jeopardy. Enough is enough. It is sad that these organizations mostly rely on fake news and disinformation to reach their conclusions, as witnessed during the Endsars protest when CNN – an otherwise respected global news network – went to town with fake news of a massacre.</p><p>“As it turned out, it was a massacre without bodies. As you are aware, we called CNN out and also petitioned the network.”</p><p>The Office of Prosecutor of the&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener><strong>International Criminal Court (ICC) had pinpointed 10 possible cases of human rights violations and war crimes</strong></a>&nbsp;in its end of the year report on preliminary examination activities.</p><p>It was gathered that the document does not provide specific allegations to be investigated by the court, however, stating that “there is sufficient evidence to be investigated by the ICC .”</p><p>The prosecutor’s office said the ICC had conducted a thorough investigation and investigated allegations of mass killings and abuse.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH1ye49uZp%2BfXamupLfLnqpmoZOYeqK5zZ6qrbFdnru1sdGnmK2hn6OurXnSmrCsZaCnvKOxjKKlraddobKst8hmqqGnn6m2r7OMqKuhnaKoerW00Z6YrWWkpHqvtcaeqaKZo2LApq%2FUq6CtsV8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
