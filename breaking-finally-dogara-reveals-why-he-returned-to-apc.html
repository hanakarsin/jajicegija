What has happened to LGA allocations since May 2019?<br>b. What happened to our campaign promise to conduct LGA elections within six months of the PDP government?<br>c. What happened to the N4.6 billion loan taken from a bank and paid directly into an private company’s account?<br>d. Why are we segmenting salaries and why is payment of salaries of state workers outsourced to a private firm as consultants?<br>e. Why are contracts inflated, awarded and payment of mobilisation done in violation of extant rules on procurement?<br>f. Why are our highly revered Traditional Rulers and Elders treated with odium contrary to the guarantee we gave during the campaign that such will not happen under a PDP government?</p><p>Mr. Chairman, you will agree with me that I cannot raise these issues and many more questions without a charge of disloyalty levelled against me if I were to remain a member of the PDP.</p><p>I cannot also fail to raise these questions now, having raised similar ones during the administrations of Governors Isa Yuguda and Mohammed A. Abubakar. If I abdicate this responsibility on the altar of partisan loyalty, I will be the most irresponsible and unprincipled politician in Bauchi State.</p><p>Thus, by this letter, I have resigned my membership of the PDP to enable me keep faith with my principle of fighting for good governance in our Dear State.</p><p>Thank you for your kind considerations.</p><p>Rt.
