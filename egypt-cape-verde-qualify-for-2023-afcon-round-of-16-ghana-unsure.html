The pharaohs equalized in the 50th minute as <a href=# rel=noopener>injured Mohamed Salah</a> watched from the stand.</p><p>In the stoppage time of the regulation time, Egypt took the lead but that didn’t last for more than 6 minutes before the Cape Verdeans equalised.</p><p>The 2-2 draw from both games means Cape Verde finished the group stage campaign as leaders of Group B with 7 points in three games. Egypt finished second with three points in three games.</p><p>As it stands, Ghana who have two points in three games will have to wait for the conclusion of the group stage as they fancy a chance of scaling through to the next round as one of the best losers. But this might be impossible as there might be more than three third placed countries that might finish the group stage campaign with at least three points.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ye5FrZp6fqaXBbq%2FAqZxmrpWnsaZ50K6YpaGWrnqnu9FmaWlqY2Kup6%2FOp2Srp6WjsW67xWZob2WXna6vrYyupaytopp8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
