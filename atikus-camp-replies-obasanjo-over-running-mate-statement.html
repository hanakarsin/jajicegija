Obasanjo said he made many mistakes in life, but that God made him overcome them.</p><p>“One of the mistakes I made was picking my number two when I wanted to become the president. But because it was a genuine mistake, God saved me,”&nbsp;Obasanjo said.</p><p>Responding to the former president in a tweet, Shehu, who is a member of the Atiku Abubakar presidential election technical committee, said Obasanjo was “still bitter” that Atiku frustrated his tenure elongation agenda, otherwise known as the ‘Third Term Agenda’ in 2007.</p><p>“Surprisingly, OBJ is still bitter about his failed 3rd term agenda. Although the PDP family holds him in high esteem, his recent statement is unbecoming. Had @atiku not fought that selfish and unconditional drive, Yar’adua, Jonathan, and Buhari wouldn’t have sniffed the presidency,” tweeted Shehu.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH13e5FvZpqsmaDCtHnCmqSpZaKava21xKxkqJqRqK6vts5mpq%2BdomK%2FtrrNoqWgZZ2WwaZ50q2YrZ2dmru1ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
