It is the responsibility of everybody to be alert and ensure safety when necessary.”</p><p>“We shouldn’t be cowards. Sometimes the bandits come with about three rounds of ammunition and when they fire shots everybody will run. In our younger days, we stand to fight any form of aggression.”</p><p>“Why should people run away from minor, minor aggressions? We should stand and face them. If these people know that the people have the competence and capability to defend themselves, they will run away.”</p><p>He further stated that the abducted students and staffs of the government school would be rescued soon.</p><p>He said the service chiefs would swing into action immediately they are through with the screening exercise by the lawmakers and track down the kidnappers to rescue the children.</p><p>Magashi said, “We have demonstrated our ability to take on the challenge. We have done it in Katsina; when children were kidnapped. Within two days, we got them back. Hopefully, this time, we will do the same (thing) to get these captives back. We are planning.”</p><p>“We have not got feedback on the activities going on in Niger State.
