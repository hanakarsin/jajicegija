The said Ms Chabot is an attache with the Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement at the American Embassy route Des Almedies BP 49 Dakar Senegal and requested that INTERPOL Nigeria assist in the abduction of Kashamu for the purpose of his forcible transportation to the US to face trial before Judge Norgel.”</i></p><p>It should be mentioned that Buruji Kashamu was little known before he returned home in 2003 from Britain, where he beat a US extradition order, to allegedly become a main sponsor of President Goodluck Jonathan's party.</p><p>Poll results posted late on April 1, Wednesday, <a href=#>Kashamu as senator-elect in southwest Ogun state</a>.
