Easter and Valentine's Day are cool and all, but it isn’t until the latter part of the year that the holidays really pop off. While Thanksgiving, Halloween, and Christmas/Hannukah normally take center stage, there are a couple of other occasions that deserve some respect on their names, too!"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

This isn’t the first year that July 4th has fallen on a weekday and it definitely won’t be the last.</p><p>Secondly, we’re still upset about it.

With July 4th falling on a Monday in 2022, we were all blessed with a three-day weekend. However, it’s likely that we won’t get that privilege on July 4th again until 2025, when the fourth of July happens to be on a Friday.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Although Independence Day falling on a weird day of the week is kind of a bummer, Distractify found a few memes that might lift your spirits.</p><p>TikTok user @<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sploww</a> used a popular scene from Succession to describe his feelings about the weekday holiday. In a clip, Jeremy Long’s Kendall Roy gives an impassioned speech. “I feel like if I don’t get to do this, I feel like that’s it — like I might die,” he says.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>“Me asking my boss to take PTO on July 3rd because July 4th decides to fall on a random a-- Tuesday this year and I want a 4-day weekend so that I can drink on the beach and celebrate America,” the user captioned the video.</p><p>And then, there was user @tonydeniese, who tried to convince her boss to take her off the schedule the following Wednesday, instead. “When the 4th of July is on a Tuesday this year and your job tried to reject your PTO for the 5th,” she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> on TikTok.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>But Twitter user @sammyzilla_ found the silver lining in the situation.</p><p>“Since the [Fourth] of July is on a Tuesday this year, I say we light them fireworks up and celebrate Monday night to enjoy our Tuesday off,” they <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a>.</p><p>And that sounds like a darned good idea.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaPAbrXFZqGupKligbW0jJ%2BYpaSjYryvecBmq66do5muug%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
