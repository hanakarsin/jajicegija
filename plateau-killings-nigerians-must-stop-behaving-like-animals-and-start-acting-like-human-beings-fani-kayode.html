Your defence is that these were reprisal killings for the slaughter of your Christian brothers and kinsmen by a group of Fulanis at an earlier date. My questions for you and those that are egging you on and clapping for you are as follows:</p><p>“Were those innocent travellers you butchered part of those that killed your Christian brothers and kinsmen at the said earlier date?</p><p>“Do two wrongs make a right?</p><p>“Is it the Christian way to target innocent and defenceless people who have done you no wrong and who present no threat and subject them to mass murder, ethnic cleansing and genocide?</p><p>“I have condemned the targeting and mass murder of Christians by Muslims consistently over the years & I have expressed outrage about this every time it happens. Am I supposed to keep quiet & relish it when it happens the other way around & when Christians murder Muslims simply because I am a Christian? Are we not all human beings with blood flowing through our veins and are these people not our compatriots? There is no reason on earth why I would not condemn the mass murder of Muslims by Christians as well & anyone that expects me to keep quiet & not wholeheartedly condemn it when such barbarity is visited upon any of my compatriots does not know FFK. We must stop behaving like animals & start acting like human beings in this country & we must stop killing one another at the drop of a hat for whatever reason.</p><p>“If we refuse to do so we will wake up one day and we will not have a country left: the only thing we will have is a massive cauldron of fire in which every single one of us is either consumed or becomes a pitiful and sorry refugee.</p><p>“No-one wins a religious or tribal war in a multi-ethnic, multi-religious and multi-cultural nation of over 210 million people. If, God forbid, it were to ever happen we will ALL suffer and we will ALL lose.</p><p>“I call for peace, calm and restraint on all sides in Plateau state and indeed throughout the country.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH15e5BvZqmkkamyosGMpKClpJmjtLR5zaKenqqZlru0ecyuqq1lo6m8sXnBnp%2BarpmjtG64yKScZpmenrqiuNJmmKecXajBor7TZpicrJmjtG64yKScZqCloq6vecGeoKefo2KzorrIZqKasZ%2BZsnA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
