If you can't capture someone's attention from the first line, then there's a good chance you'll never hear from that person again. Bye bye love, bye bye happiness, hello loneliness...you know the rest.</p><p>The thing is, online dating has been evolving and we constantly have to evolve with it. That means going to some extremes that can be borderline offensive. Or just plain bold.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">1. This person did a pretty great job with their "select a joke" method.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Things get real dark, real fast, but it looks like the two of them are a match in messed-up joke heaven.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">2. For some of these people though, you have to wonder if they're taking it a little too far.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Joking about murdering someone just to get your dog back is a delicate jibe to make and I'm not so sure this person pulled it off, but maybe the kissy lips all over this exchange mean otherwise.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">3. Timely reference? Check. Way too soon? Double check.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Appreciation of such a bold and possibly insensitive joke? Triple check.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">4. Not sure it went further after this.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>But at least they were having fun with it. Britteny also doesn't know any better, that's an amazing pickup line.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">5. Some people just put some wholesome messages on their bio.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>It can get kind of depressing and lonely when you're constantly swiping through hordes of people hoping to find a meaningful connection. I'm sure this was a welcome respite for a few weary singles.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">6. Some jokes are so weird, you can't believe they actually worked.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>And it looks like this one did. I'm not sure I get it, but she didn't immediately block whoever sent this, so that's a good sign.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">7. Pokemon reference is a bold strategy.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>It was that straightforward and that easy. I guess if you find a fellow nerd, all is well in the Tinder world.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">8. What? Wait, what?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Why would you say that to anyone, even as a joke, especially when you're just meeting them? I guess it paid off, though. Unless she was just looking for snap followers.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">9. The puns just keep coming.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>I personally thought it was vera creative and evera person who comes across this should appreciate it.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">10. Ah yes, a one nightstand joke. Let's see how it plays out.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Well pretty darn good. If she doesn't like coffee, then I'm assuming alcohol is a welcome substitute.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">11. This IS so sweet.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>&nbsp;Come on, bro, I ain't trying to cry reading Tinder messages.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">12. Sometimes Tinder's interesting just for the clapbacks.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>And our girl Jasmine here provided a delicious rejoinder to this person's very disrespectful opening question.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">13. The hits just keep on coming.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>This kind of savagery is usually reserved for the Colosseum, but all is fair in right-swiping and war I guess.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">14. Some Tinder accounts are there just as jokes.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>What a wonderful reason to use the platform. Also, I never thought garlic bread could be so filthy. Who knew?</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">15. Whether you love or hate puns, it doesn't really matter.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>They always have the same effect: you groan but still find yourself laughing anyway.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">16. Whoever sent this message must be very, very good looking.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Because that opening line wasn't that good to get that kind of sexually aggressive response. Amazing.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">17. Some of the jokes were really, really good.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>I'm gonna have to steal that one.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">18. Since this began with a dark joke...</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>...it's only right that it ends with one. Looks like they found love in a hopeless place. On second though, I don't know if they're living in New Jersey so I take that back.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqLmqr8pmq6KmlJq%2FbrPAppys</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
