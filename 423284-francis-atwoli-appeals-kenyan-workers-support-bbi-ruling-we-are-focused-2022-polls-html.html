Therefore, the role of politics in the country's development and especially the workers cannot be downplayed,'' Atwoli explained.<p class=align-left>He said that the <a href=#>BBI</a> was close to his heart because of his love for the country.</p>''I, therefore, would appeal particularly to workers that I represent, more than 4 million of them, to support the ruling. We don't want to go against it; we are not appealing; we will not push politicians to make sure they go to court and appeal,'' he said.<p class=align-left>The veteran trade unionist termed 2022 as a year of change to the needs of workers.</p>''I want to make it clear that the BBI ruling is behind us now, and as the workers, we are the people who were hard hit. But I must also say that there will be many changes after the forthcoming polls favourable to the amendments of the Kenyan constitution,'' said the unionist.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/6696471f713662ac.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Lawyer Ahmednasir Says Taking BBI to Supreme Court will be Waste of Time</span></p></a><h2>Focusing on the 2022 General Election</h2><p class=align-left>He said that COTU is focusing on the <a href=#>2022 General Election</a>, maintaining that they can see victory at the end of the tunnel.</p>''Those celebrating can continue doing so, but their celebrations might be cut short by the results that they might not be able to accept or agree with in the next year's polls,'' he said.<p class=align-left><a href=#>A seven-judge Court of Appeal bench</a> on Friday, August 20, <a href=#>found the process unconstitutional </a>and handed the promoters a blow that could potentially stop the sounds and drumbeats of BBI reggae.</p><p class=align-left>The voluminous judgment presented far-reaching political and legal implications and exposed President Uhuru Kenyatta and his role in the amendment of the 2010 Constitution.</p><p class=align-left>The Court of Appeal president Daniel Musinga and judge Patrick Kiage, in their lengthy submissions, agreed with the bench that the president's role is limited to protecting and defending the Constitution.</p><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnCAkWxpcWxdm7%2BiusKiqmaZpKy8rbWMmqepnZGhwG63xKewmqZdrLyzt8SrqmarpaW9sL7TZpmboV2nwq21zaBksJ1dlr%2BmecWomq6rlZl6c3yRa2Spp5yhwG%2B006aj</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
