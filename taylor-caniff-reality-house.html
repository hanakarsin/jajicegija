In its second season, The Reality House is a combination of your favorite shows, such as Big Brother, Real World, and Fear Factor.</p><p>Basically, 12 popular YouTubers were chosen by JC and Kian to live in a house and are tasked with competing in challenges. The final person left standing will walk away with $50,000. The contestants in Season 2 include: Manny MUA, Brittany Broski (aka Kombucha Girl), Harrison Webb, Lena the Plug, Ryan Abe, Tabatha Lawley, Yousef Erakat, Imari Stuart, Kenny Knox, Teala Dunn, Taylor Blake, and <a href=#>Andrea Russett.</a></p><p>However, one competitor was not originally cast on the show. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taylor Caniff</a> was reportedly supposed to star on Season 2 of The Reality House. &nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Taylor Caniff was apparently supposed to star on 'The Reality House.'</h2><p>In a vlog uploaded by Imari on Jan. 19, the content creator told fans that he was not originally cast on the popular digital competition series. "Honestly, I wasn't supposed to be on the show," he revealed. "Taylor Caniff was supposed to be on the show. He didn't do it for some reason."&nbsp;</p><p>While it's unclear why the former Vine star decided not to do the series, Taylor has been known throughout his career as a controversial internet celeb.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2014, the 23-year-old was involved in a public feud with fellow YouTuber Tyler Oakley, who called him out for homophobic comments. "I'm not a homophobic in any way if your happy that's all that matters but this kid needs to stop trying to act like he owns the internet," Taylor tweeted in response.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>It‚Äôs almost my birthday so that means per diem ü§† Also thank you @boohoomanofficial for keeping me laced ü§ù have you checked out there after pay system?</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Taylor Michael Caniff</a> (@taylorcaniff) on Jan 17, 2020 at 12:21pm PST</p></figure><p>In 2017, Tana Mongeau made a video titled, "Taylor Caniff is a transphobic piece of s--t." In the vlog, Tana called out the social media celeb calling him "problematic." Tana explained to fans in the video why she personally has a problem with Taylor, revealing that he would constantly reintroduce himself to her, even though they followed each other on social media.</p><p>She then talked about the homophobic comments he's made, such as calling people in the LGBTQ+ community the "f-word." Tana explained her friend and fellow YouTuber Corinna Kopf was living with Taylor for a bit because she was in a tight spot with money.</p><p>Concluding, "I think the world should know how shitty of a f--king person you are, if you wanna keep coming for me."</p><p>Well, we wonder if Taylor will possibly join Season 3 of The Reality House?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who will be in Season 3 of 'The Reality House'?</h2><p>"[Tana's] a really good friend... but she's very busy," <a href=#>Kian said on Access Hollywood</a>. We asked her to be in a couple of things before and she's flaked for certain reasons. We actually asked her to be on Season 1... Season 2 came around and I think we asked her again, it was a no again. So, we got her best friend Imari, which is like Tana in a boy form."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>And, a few more famous faces could be joining the Season 3 cast. "We would for sure want Shane [Dawson], we would want Jeffree [Star] ... I've seen a lot of mentions saying they want to see James Charles in there," Kian revealed.</p><p>For now, we'll just anxiously wait to learn who will be joining the show for Season 3.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqa66uM6rZJyZnp6zp3nRnpiloaSueqm71Kyc</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
