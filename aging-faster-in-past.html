"This is nonsense," he wrote, "but did people in the past look older when they were younger?" In other words, did people used to age way more rapidly than they do today?&nbsp;</p><p>Hundreds of people responded with pictures proving that yes, this is indeed the case. People who were 30 years old in the 1920s and '30s look like people in their 40s and 50s today. It's bizarre! The following pictures are proof of this phenomenon.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">1. Parents</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>Was it the clothes they were wearing? The hairstyles? The fact that the photo is in black and white? But the pleated pants up to his chest is one thing. The receding hairline at 23 years old is another thing.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">2. Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>The Rock looked older in high school than he does right now. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/QS2yM7z4gH</a></p>— 𝙽. 𝚃𝚑𝚘𝚖𝚊𝚜 𝚁𝚒𝚘𝚜 (@nthomasrios) <a href=#>December 27, 2019</a></figure><p>There are a few pictures of The Rock as a young man floating around the internet, and if I'm being totally honest, they're not enough. We need more. We deserve them. That pencil thin, Gomez Addams mustache really is something else.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">3. John Ratzenberger and George Wendt</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>George Wendt I can kind of believe because even though he's in an old man suit, he has sort of a baby face. But John Ratzenberger? Thirty-four years old?! What happened to him?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">4. Wilford Brimley</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Wilford Brimley was 50 in Cocoon. Tom Cruise was 56 in the latest Mission Impossible. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/vRBvu2TLi7</a></p>— Andrew Brennan (@andbrnn) <a href=#>December 27, 2019</a></figure><p>It's a little bit unfair to compare Tom Cruise to anyone, but the difference between him at 56 and Wilford Brimley at 50 is staggering. Many in the comments are citing the proliferation of cigarettes and alcohol in those days as the reason people look so much other then. That's definitely got to be part of it.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">5. Sir Bobby Charlton</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>1969. Sir Bobby Charlton was *32*. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/H7bbgF027t</a></p>— Shane Bua (@ThatShaneBua) <a href=#>December 27, 2019</a></figure><p>Several people included soccer players from the '60s and '70s on this list because they all looked so old for some reason. I cannot believe Sir Bobby Charlton was only 32 in this picture. He looks like Paul Simon's cranky older brother.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">6. Ray Nitschke</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>This beats Ray Nitschke aged 29 as the most amazing one yet <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/AOzn2KwxQF</a></p>— z (@zamartin) <a href=#>December 27, 2019</a></figure><p>Oh my goodness. Were football helmets in those days more likely to rub all the hair off your head? Some people these days do go bald in their 20s. It happens! But very few embrace the side wisps. That's reserved for old men. Here's a word to the wise: If you start going bald as a young person, just shave it. Shave it all.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">7. Jim Croce</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>We call this age anomaly “the Jim Croce.” This is a man who died at !30! <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/YvU1YUKWGG</a></p>— Daniel Kreps (@danielkreps) <a href=#>December 27, 2019</a></figure><p>OK, Jim Croce definitely looks older than 30, but if you take off his mustache or twirl the ends of it with wax, he kind of looks like every Williamsburg hipster in 2019. Sorry. It's just the truth.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">8. Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, and J. P. Richardson Jr.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>The day the music died. Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and The Big Bopper. Age 23, 17 and 28 respectively at the time of death. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/t15LU9r1VW</a></p>— Mike (@MikeI70) <a href=#>December 27, 2019</a></figure><p>This is truly insane. If I was presented with these pictures and asked to guess their ages, I would have, with no hesitation, said Buddy Holly was 16, Ritchie Valens was 33, and The Big Bopper was...also 33. Buddy Holly looks like a child.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">9. Grandparents</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>This phenomenon is particularly dramatic in people's family photos for some reason. The craziest part is that the baby is only two months old! OK, I made that up.&nbsp;</p><p>My parents are about the same age as the grandparents in these photos, and they look way, way younger than this.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">10. Otis Nixon</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Otis Nixon was 36 here: <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/wEVpHZfQ9f</a></p>— Adam J. Morris (@lonestarball) <a href=#>December 27, 2019</a></figure><p>Even in the '90s, people looked far older than they do today. Otis Nixon may have been 36, but he looks like he had the most stressful baseball career in the history of the sport.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">11. John Tenta</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>Wrestlers do a lot of crazy things to their bodies, but 26. Twenty-six. There is probably no point in history at which he would look 26 years old. He probably came out of the womb with that beard.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">12. Pat Morita</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Ralph Macchio is about the same age now that Pat Morita was at the time of The Karate Kid. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/oF7CBOrERj</a></p>— Zappaneese (@zappaneese) <a href=#>December 27, 2019</a></figure><p>This cannot be. To be fair, Ralph Macchio has always had an extreme baby face. But still, these two do not at all seem like they're the same age. Maybe it's because Ralph Macchio waxes on more than Pat Morita, if you know what I mean (I don't even know what I mean).&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">13. Rollie Fingers</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Rollie Fingers was 28 or 29 when this photo was taken. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/bSApPCB1qY</a></p>— Scott B (@delightfullydad) <a href=#>December 27, 2019</a></figure><p>Again, I think if you saw Rollie Fingers in a Bushwick record store today, you wouldn't blink an eye. It might just be the uniform and the weird look on his face. Baseball cards are so funny. Did he pose for this? Did they take several pictures and then go, "This one! Such a natural position to be standing in! And a brilliant facial expression!"</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">14. Greg Oden</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>This man was 19 years old when this photo was taken <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/f78Gf8VUHb</a></p>— Zack Jones (@CrazyJoeNash) <a href=#>December 27, 2019</a></figure><p>I am often dumfounded by athletes' appearances when I am watching college sports. I think today, some of them are "super seniors" who red-shirted for a year and so they're really like 20 or 21, but the fact that Greg Oden is 19 in this photo is bonkers.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">15. Florence Owens Thompson</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>She was 32 when this photo was taken. Then again, the Great Depression can do that to you. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/YObE1g4MWu</a></p>— Philip Klinkner (@pklinkne) <a href=#>December 31, 2019</a></figure><p>So yes, this was the Great Depression. But having seen this famous Dorothea Lange photo many times, it is absolutely shocking that Florence is 32 years old in it. I'm almost 31. Do I look like that?&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">16. Carroll O'Connor</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Sure, this is a crazy fact, but even crazier to me is that Jean Stapleton, who played Edith Bunker, is one year older than Carroll O'Connor. She looks so much younger than him!!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">17. George "Duke" Harris</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>This is former NHL/WHA hockey player George "Duke" Harris. Born in 1942, he was 31 when this pic was taken. <a href=#>https://t.co/YAQBgIct46</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/wehGuqsNm5</a></p>— J.S. 🅙 (@realjasonstru) <a href=#>December 27, 2019</a></figure><p>Wow. Oh wow. Out definition of what athletes look like really has changed over the years, hasn't it? I guess back in the day, it was totally cool for hockey players to be 31 years old and yet somehow look exactly like Grandpa Munster.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">18. Ron Karkovice</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>1987. Ron Karkovice was 24 years old. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/XNrFBPZiAW</a></p>— Jody Gage Memorial Tweet Machine (@CerowB) <a href=#>December 27, 2019</a></figure><p>I thought this guy kind of looked like every guy on my college's baseball team, but then I realized he has a very blond mustache, which ages him so much. Why were mustaches such a thing? I'm glad we've graduated to beards. Beards are better than mustaches.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">19. 'The Mary Tyler Moore Show' Cast</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Yes , just look at Mary Tyler Moore cast as proof</p><p>Ages when this photo was taken:<br>Front row: 39, 33, 46<br>Back row: 30, 40, 44 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/9M0YMOWWKT</a></p>— eckhaus (@eckhaus) <a href=#>December 27, 2019</a></figure><p>I love this show so much, and this is a good reminder to watch it again. I have to say, Ted Knight definitely looks older than 46, but Cloris Leachman is a total babe! She's 11 years older than Mary Tyler Moore, and you would never know it.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">20. Gump Worsley</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>This is hockey’s Gump Worsley. Born in 1929, this is a picture of him with the Montreal Canadiens. The last year he played with Montreal was 1970, when Gump was 41 years old. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/XQjJRavfNQ</a></p>— Dave (@RunnerDave20194) <a href=#>December 27, 2019</a></figure><p>I mean, come on. With a name like Gump Worsley, you have to look like that at age 41. Can you imagine some suave, John Stamos looking guy with the name Gump? No, you cannot.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">21. Elizabeth Taylor</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Liz Taylor is 17 here. She is stunning as always but could be in her mid to late 20s <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/oULQXbFNNO</a></p>— Robyn Citizen (@rMeredithc) <a href=#>December 28, 2019</a></figure><p>Elizabeth Taylor is a legend, and I've seen this photo a bunch of times, but I never realized that she was 17 in it. Women were forced to become adults so much earlier back then.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">22. Grzegorz Lato</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Soccer players in the 70s looked super old. This is one of the stars of the 1974 World Cup, Grzegorz Lato. He was 24 years old at the time <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/JB7kvwsNLZ</a></p>— Dominik Stecuła (@decustecu) <a href=#>December 31, 2019</a></figure><p>It really seems like having a career in soccer in the '60s or '70s did something to a man because they all looked extremely old. I really have a hard time believing this guy is 24. In this picture, he looks just like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Prince Philip today</a>, and he's 98.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">23. Hank Williams</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Hank Williams died at age 29. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/QbRyZjyQ5J</a></p>— Chris Carter (@ccktwb) <a href=#>December 28, 2019</a></figure><p>I have to be honest; I didn't know much about Hank Williams. I had no idea that he died when he was only 29 years old... probably because he looks at least 37 in this photo.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">24. Joe McCarthy</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Brandon McCarthy played his age 30 season for the NYY. Here’s a picture of Brandon McCarthy while he was with the Yankees: <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Chb0g5Q3Wz</a></p>— Kevin Scudero (@KevinScudero) <a href=#>December 27, 2019</a></figure><p>Joe McCarthy was in his early 40s when he became a coach for the Yankees. But he looks 60. He's probably pointing to a mirror saying, "That's not what I look like. I'm 44. No seriously, that can't be me."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">25. Otis Redding</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I can’t believe that no one has mentioned Otis Redding in this thread. He was 26 when he died. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/azfLfxdF2d</a></p>— VenikaDewan (@WhatsSleepTho) <a href=#>December 30, 2019</a></figure><p>I knew that Otis Redding died at a young age, but I didn't realize he was 26. He looks way older than that, and I'm telling you, it's the mustache. Fellas. Mustaches age you 15 years minimum. Take that into consideration before you decide to grow one.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflrSqusZmnZqrpJq%2FbrXNZqeaq6Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
