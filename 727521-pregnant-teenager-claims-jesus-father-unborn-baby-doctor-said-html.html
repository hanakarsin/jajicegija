Latifah Smith-Nabengana, a pregnant 15-year-old teenager from Ohio has claimed that Jesus Christ is the father of her unborn baby.

Those were the mighty men who were of old, men of renown."</p><p>Everyone in her family has since shown support for her since she announced it to them.</p><p>Dr William Franklin Murphy, who has been monitoring the teenager's pregnancy, informed that he is aware of her version, but is unable to either confirm or invalidate her claims.</p><p>The gynecologist said: <i>"For all I know, her pregnancy seems normal.&nbsp;Her claims of 'Virgin pregnancy' are technically true, but that doesn’t mean there was a divine intervention. I can tell you that it’s a boy, but there no way for me to determine if it is Jesus’ son until he is born. If she asks for a DNA test at that time, then we can tell you who the father is."</i></p><p>The doctor, being aware of some laws concerning medical secrets, refused to discuss any detail concerning the young woman’s pregnancy.</p><p>The young lady has further stated that she wants a paternity test as soon as her son is born, just to show that she was not hallucinating with her claims.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkhHODlGtoZqiimrSvrc2tZK2dlaOuqLHRZpqlmZmiwG62xKysrGWWlsGpsdFmrKean6e7bq7Am7BmnJ%2BYwbC%2BjKyYopxencGuuA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
