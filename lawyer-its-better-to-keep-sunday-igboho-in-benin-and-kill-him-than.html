That has been our struggle and agitation here in Benin.”</p><p>Salami, who is also a professor at a University in Benin, pointed out that&nbsp;it would be difficult for Igboho to be extradited to Nigeria because there is no extradition treaty or accord between both countries.</p><p>“For someone to be extradited from one country to another, there must be a law between both countries, we call it accord for extradition. That accord does not exist between both countries.</p><p>“To extradite him will be difficult, but in politics, we cant say. But by law, there is no extradition accord between Nigeria and Benin,” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH14e5FtZqWZp66ys3nIrapmmpWpwaa%2BjK2mZqOVmr1uv9Snm5qxXZ60o7vHqGSipl2Xsq%2B1zWaYp5xdoLatuIyhoKZlpJ2ur3s%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
