Source: GettyCanal Walk in downtown Indianapolis is a picturesque area that's wonderful for a stroll, run, dog walk, or people-watching during fairer weather. In the winter time, the canal can freeze due to the fact that Indiana can reach below-freezing temperatures.
An arctic freeze that dominated most of the country did affect Indianapolis, however, rendering the city more frigid than usual, freezing large portions of the canal."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

You would not confuse this for a road."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @rachelbowling2</span></figure><p>To further drive her point home, she uploaded yet another clip of her at a park near the canal in response to another user who asked, "the real question is how did she drive onto it?"</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@tinisha.xoxo href=#>@tinisha.xoxo</a><p>Replying to @jakobstone Answering the million dollar question.

So yeah, that's the street, up top guys. She drove under the street all the way down here and then fell in where the ice breaks off over there."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @rachelbowling2</span></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ABC Chicago</a> reported that the incident occurred on Christmas Day 2022.
