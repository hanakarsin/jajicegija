The group consists of Robert E. Reeves, Michael "Mick" Peterson, Jessay Martin, and Bill Lyons.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram / @theoldgays</a></figure><p>According to an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Today</a>, Bill and Michael knew each other for years and reconnected in the early 2000s. They began living together, and then eventually, Mick moved in as well. Jessay ended up moving in across the street, and they all became friends.</p><p>Later on, one of their friends introduced them to their producer, and they started making content online from there.
