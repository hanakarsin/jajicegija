While they weren't on-stage to attest to Kai’s claims of Donald Trump's generosity and doting nature as a grandfather, they too are close to the extended family. They kind of have to be when their grandfather is one of the most famous people in the world and their dad readily stands by his side when needed.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@kaitrumpgolfer</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Who is Kai Madison Trump?</h2><p>During her speech at the RNC, Kai spoke about her close relationship with her grandfather and the person that other people don't see while they "put [him] through hell." She opened up about how close they are and how proud Donald Trump is of her and his other grandchildren. One of the things Kai and her grandpa bond over is golf and, it appears, Kai is an avid golfer. Her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> is full of posts about enjoying the sport, both with and without her grandpa by her side.</p><p>Kai has even won small championships as a female golfer.</p><p>"I am really excited to have won the ladies club championship @trumpgolfpalmbeach," she shared in a March 2024 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram post</a>. "Great competition from some impressive players. I shot even both days and won both matches. Very proud of my game and where it’s heading but there is always room for improvement. I would like to thank my parents, family and the amazing team at @trumpgolf."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@kaitrumpgolfer</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Kai Madison Trump's mom divorced Donald Trump Jr. in 2018.</h2><p>Donald Trump Jr. is engaged to Kimberly Guilfoyle, but he was married to the mother of all of his five kids, Vanessa Haydon, from 2005 until 2018. It's unclear when he plans to wed Kimberly, but Donald Trump Jr. has been with her for the better part of the last decade. Kai’s mom is actually Donald Trump Jr.’s first wife, however, so you have to expect that the exes get along well to co-parent their five children. Besides Kai, they share four other children.</p><p>In March 2018, the couple shared in a joint <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a>, “We have decided to go our separate ways.” Around that time, sources claimed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six</a> that Donald Trump Jr. kept a close eye on the budget he allowed for his then-wife. To some, it was allegedly only a matter of time before the pair split up.</p><p>However, that appears to now be in the past, as both Donald Trump Jr. and Vanessa have moved on from their marriage. They continue to share <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">custody</a> of their children.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbyvrcudZK2qpaK9brbRZpuarZedwaa%2B</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
