But fans of 2000's TV will recognize that none are more formative than <a href=#>iCarly</a>, featuring Miranda Cosgrove, Nathan Kress, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennette McCurdy</a>. With a reboot (or is it more of a sequel?) underway, and the main cast signed on, fans are desperate to know: Where is Jennette McCurdy <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">now</a>?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jennette McCurdy has acted in projects since her departure from 'Sam & Cat.'</h2><p>Fans will have to stretch their memories back to 2013 when Jennette left iCarly and Victorious spinoff Sam & Cat over alleged financial disputes between her salary and Ariana Grande's. While this did cause a large controversy in both fan bases, she made up with Ariana and continued acting in wildly different projects.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>In 2014, Jennette starred in a web series known as What's Next For Sarah?, loosely based on her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">own life</a> and experiences. She also began starring in the Netflix drama series Between. However, when Between was canceled, Jennette expressed frustration with her acting experiences and decided to turn her attention to writing <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">and directing</a> instead.</p><p>While her directorial debut Kenny is available to watch on YouTube, Jennette has directed several more films. In fact, since 2017, Jennette has written and directed three different films: The Grave, The McCurdys, and Strong Independent Women. These films tackle subjects that range from grief to disordered eating.</p><p>Unfortunately, Jennette is no stranger to either subject. Her mother <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">died</a> after a 17-year battle with cancer in 2013. Prior to her death, Jennette had written an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">article</a> in the Wall Street Journal to give advice on living with an ill parent.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>In 2019, Jennette wrote a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">personal essay</a> for the Huffington Post detailing her eating disorder, from which she had been in recovery for two years. Jennette pointed to a childhood in Hollywood and a parent who also struggled with disordered eating as two major factors in the development of her own struggle.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">More recently, Jennette has been focusing on self-care and new horizons.</h2><p>Thankfully, it seems that despite many years of struggle and suffering, Jennette is turning over a new leaf. She credited therapy in the Huffington Post article for helping her recovery, and has taken her passions in television and film to write autobiographical content.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2020, Jennette performed a tragicomedy one-woman show called I'm Glad My Mom Died in theaters around Los Angeles and New York. She took a hiatus from the show when the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) began to impact the United States, and instead took to YouTube to express herself. Jennette has recently posted videos of original <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">songs dealing with quarantining</a> and her new podcast, Empty Inside.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jennette on why she quit acting: "I resent my career in a lot of ways."</h2><p>During a Feb. 24 episode of her podcast, Jennette sat down with Anna Faris and touched upon her child acting days.</p><p>“My mom put me in it when I was 6 and by sort of age, I guess, 10 or 11, I was the main financial support for my family," she shared. "My family didn’t have a lot of money, and this was the way out, which I actually think was helpful in driving me to some degree of success."</p><p>Jennette went on to say that although her mother's death played a huge role in her stepping away from acting, her childhood credits didn't inspire her to stick with it, either.</p><p>“I resent my career in a lot of ways," she said. "I feel so unfulfilled by the roles that I played and felt like it was the most just cheesy, embarrassing [experience]."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Jennette McCurdy (@jennettemccurdy)</a></p><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Unfortunately, this means the chances of Jennette reprising her role as Sam on the <a href=#>iCarly reboot</a> — which is coming to Paramount Pictures' streaming service — are pretty much slim to none.
