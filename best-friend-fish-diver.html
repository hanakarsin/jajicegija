There's something extra adorable about unlikely animal-human friendships.
Maybe it's because deep down inside, we all really want to see everybody get along. I mean, why else would we get all misty-eyed when a wolf ends up taking care of a lost baby instead of tearing them to shreds?
Whatever the reason, it's awesome to witness. Especially when the animals aren't really known for being cuddly or affectionate."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The shrine is home to many different species of fish that have grown accustomed to Arakawa, chief among them is an Asian Sheepshead Wrasse named Yoriko.</p><p>Each time Arakawa dives underwater to check on the shrine, he greets Yoriko with a kiss. It's a tradition the two have been sharing for decades and was finally captured on camera.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p><a href=#>via GIPHY</a></p></figure><p>Fish often have a reputation of being "dumb," but it turns out that our aquatic ancestors' brains are capable of some pretty complex cognitive functions, like facial recognition. In a study published on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Phys.org</a>, researchers trained fish to spit jets of water at faces they recognized and the results from the experiments were pretty incredible.</p>"Archerfish are a species of tropical freshwater fish that spit a jet of water from their mouth to knock down insects in branches above the water. We positioned a computer monitor that showed images of human faces above the aquariums and trained them to spit at a particular face. Once the fish had learned to recognize a face, we then showed them the same face, as well as a series of new ones.In all cases, the fish continued to spit at the face they had been trained to recognize, proving that they were capable of telling the two apart. Even when we did this with faces that were potentially more difficult because they were in black and white and the head shape was standardized, the fish were still capable of finding the face they were trained to recognize."<figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>You can learn more about Arakawa and Yoriko's friendship by checking out this <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook page</a> that's filled with awesome videos of Arakawa at work with Yoriko by his side.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>So cool.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaJmenrqiuNJoaWlpZ2R9d3uRb2aTfpWNlrF7wZ6qrWWWp7amusNmnaKrmGKxqsLEqw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
