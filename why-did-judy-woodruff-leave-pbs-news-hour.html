So, why exactly did she leave her post on PBS NewsHour?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Judy Woodruff decided to leave ‚ÄòPBS NewsHour‚Äô to work on ‚ÄòAmerica at a Crossroads.‚Äô</h2><p>Judy first fell into journalism after studying political science at <a href=#>Duke University</a>, where she grew impassioned with solving America‚Äôs crises. However, after seeing the way women were treated in Washington D.C. in the 1960s, she decided to pivot into broadcast journalism, where she found her calling and met her now-husband, Al Hunt.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: PBS</span><p>Judy Woodruff moderates the 1988 Vice Presidential debate</p></figure><p>Judy has always been deeply concerned with America‚Äôs political issues, but the recent decades have taken a toll on her belief system.

He was born in 1981 with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">spina bifida</a>, a medical condition that happens when the spinal cord doesn‚Äôt fully close during pregnancy. It can cause weakened legs, incontinence, and fluid in the brain. Judy and Al tried to give Jeffrey a normal childhood with much success.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook/@kennedykrieger</a><p>Judy Woodruff with son Jeffrey at a Cure LBSL Event</p></figure><p>However, after his doctor recommended an operation to replace a shunt, which was inserted to drain excess fluids, he was left permanently disabled at the age of 16 years old.
