The delay according to a communique made available to newsmen on Monday morning was due to the inability of many ministries and agencies to conclude their procurement process until the last quarter of this year.
Naija News understands that there was an outright ban placed on the procurement process between January to May 31, 2021, and this was capitalized on by many agencies as the reason why they could not meet up with performances."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Funds were released to the MDAs but they were not able to do anything because of lockdown.</p><p>“At the end of the day, the government extended the implementation of the 2020 capital budget to 2021.</p><p>“This affected the 2021 budget because the implementation of the capital projects for 2022 did not start early because of the situation last year.</p><p>“Funds had been released for the implementation of capital projects for this year and work had started in earnest.</p><p>“We will, however, look at the situation. Whatever is necessary we will do it in a way that would allow for free flow of the process for the implementation of capital projects.</p><p>“We are working with the executive on that. We would look at all the factors. We will consult with the executive and find the best way possible to utilise the money realised if they had not been expended before the end of the year,” the chairman added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5ye5FyZmtoYmZ6o8HDoJytZZmiva2xzJ6lrZmknryvec6fZJyZoJ7BoriMqamoopWYwbR5zJqwZp2oqbKvsIytpmamla3BbsXEmqlmnpdk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
