Every couple from Married at First Sight might not work out, but Season 11's Woody and Amani have proved that the experiment does work for some. It worked so well for them that in February 2022, they announced they were expecting their first child together."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Unlike some couples in the franchise, Woody and Amani were clearly well-matched and they fell for each other fast.</p><p>They even made the experts tear up when they gushed about their shared love on Decision Day. The fact that they now have a growing family shows just how real their love was from the beginning.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Woody and Amani Randall / Kinetic Content</span><p>Woody and Amani's son.</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">'MAFS' couple Woody and Amani had their new baby.</h2><p>Woody and Amani welcomed their son, Reign, to the world on June 3, 2022. Woody posted the announcement on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> shortly after his birth. And a statement from Kinetic Content that was shared with Distractify, the doting parents opened up about their thoughts as Mom and Dad.</p><p>"It's still pretty early but we think he may look more like Woody, and he may have Woody's eyes. I think he has my nose," Amani said.</p><p>Woody shared, "I'm very excited for Father's Day. I'm looking forward to taking all the cheesy pictures with my baby, and wearing matching outfits."</p><p>Both Woody and Amani shared Amani's pregnancy journey on social media. Amani even made a TikTok on her due date asking followers for tips on how to induce labor. Before the birth, neither of them knew the sex of their baby, prompting some of their fans to wonder if Amani was pregnant with twins. For now, it's just the one.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Woodrow Randall (@mrabove)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">There are other babies in the 'Married at First Sight' franchise.</h2><p>While Woody and Amani are the most recent couple in the MAFS franchise to have a baby, they aren't the only ones to start a family after finding love on the show.
