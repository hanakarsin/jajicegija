Her two sons were up against each other in the NBA conference finals</h3><p class=align-left>Sonya Curry is the mother of Stephen and Seth Curry. Stephen is a professional basketball player who plays for the Golden State Warriors and is a six-time NBA All-Star. Seth is also a professional basketball player who plays for the Dallas Mavericks. During the NBA Western Conference finals of May 2019, the two brothers faced off. At that time, Seth was playing for the Portland Trail Blazers. It was the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">first time </a>in the NBA history that two brothers went head-to-head in the conference finals.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/b76cd14ac0127141.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Cam Newton's wife? Here's everything you need to know</span></p></a><p class=align-left>It was tricky for Sonya and Dell Curry to determine whom to support in those finals. Since they had to wear a jersey for either team, they flipped a coin to decide who would sport the Warriors jersey and who would take the Blazers jersey. During the game, Sonya <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">strolled into the arena</a> wearing the Portland Trail Blazers jersey.</p><p class=align-left>Despite that, she found herself cheering for both her sons. When either of her two sons did something fantastic in the game, the two parents kept clapping because they could not help themselves. In the end, Sonya was a proud mother of two sons who made history.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/f0d99cbf0c77e835.jpeg><h3>2. She founded a school</h3><p class=align-left>Sonya Curry is the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">president</a> of the Christian Montessori School of Lake Norman. It is a school located in Huntersville, North Carolina, United States. She <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">founded the school</a> in 1995 to ensure the academic and spiritual development of the entire child through the Montessori Method of education.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/c8edea257553f549.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Montana Helena Klein Yao: What you should know about Malik Beasley's wife</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The school also dedicates itself to the following of Christ. It adheres to a method of education and philosophy geared towards developing creative and independent children who have an enthusiasm for learning.</p><p class=align-left>Because of her difficult upbringing and the challenges of race, Sonya founded the school to ensure it was open to all children regardless of their colour, creed, race, or national origin. The learning institution is private and non-profit. All her children <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">attended the school</a>, and they always went together while she was an educator.</p><h3>3.

The honours made the volleyball team famous. Many of her former friends and college roommates say the popularity of the team was primarily <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">due to her</a>. Sonya was only 5-5 tall. Despite her height, she was an excellent leaper, quiet, determined, serious, and a self-motivated team leader.</p><p class=align-left>She led the Virginia Tech volleyball team to win <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">several awards</a>. One was the State AA championship. Sonya also received the Virginia Defensive Player of the Year Award. Her basketball team won two state awards. Sonya’s success as an athlete has been replicated by his sons, who have won various awards and championships in their respective basketball careers.</p><h3>4. She was a strict mom to her children</h3><p class=align-left>Interviews of Sonya and her sons conducted over the years by different publications show she was a strict mother to her children. In 2018, she revealed what it took to raise her children. During that interview by <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">today.com</a>, she said that her family was always like any other NBA squad where teamwork mattered. All her kids had some form of activity in the evening, and nobody would miss out.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/71accc0827e5912c.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Olivia Namath: 5 quick facts about Joe Namath's daughter</span></p></a><p class=align-left>One day she made Stephen sit out of a middle-school basketball game because he had not done his chores. In another instance, she sent Stephen a video telling him to wash his mouth out. That came after the NBA All-Star cursed during a basketball playoff game. She sent the message as soon as Stephen stepped off the court.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Aleize Sampson bio, current partner, daughter, net worth and photos</p><p class=align-left>Despite her methods, her children always praised her. Stephen once <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">praised her</a> for being a strong woman. He also praised her for doing a fantastic job with him and his siblings, and that she deserves all the credit for how they turned out.</p><h3>5. She was once heckled for supporting her son</h3><p class=align-left>During game five of the 2019 NBA finals, Sonya and Dell Curry received a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">cold reception</a> from Toronto Raptors fans. The Raptors fans heckled them after a game in which they lost 106-105 to Golden State Warriors. That was not expected because Canada has always had a reputation for being cordial and friendly.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/cb83cec1fdb8ce48.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kerri Browitt Caviezel: The untold story of Jim Caviezel's wife</span></p></a><p class=align-left>But since the two are parents of Stephen Curry who plays for the Warriors, it came as no surprise. Perhaps another reason for heckling was because Toronto Raptors were one game away from winning the playoffs for the first time in the franchise history. Also, throughout the game, the fans cheered as Kevin Durant of Golden State Warriors re-injured his Achilles. The pain of losing saw them lash out at Sonya Curry outside of her hotel after the match.</p><h3>6. She has a motto for her family</h3><p class=align-left>Sonya Curry had a tough upbringing. She grew up in extreme poverty and had to tackle the challenges of racial abuses. But her hard work and faith enabled her to be a successful athlete, educator, and a proud mother.

That has been the family motto that has guided them through the years. Her faith allowed her to overcome the challenges of poverty and race and became a successful athlete. It also allowed her to make her children have faith in God. Stephen, for example, lists “believer” on his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">social media profiles</a> because it is the roots of everything he does.</p><p class=align-left>Her faith in God also made her establish a private, non-profit Christian school in Huntersville, North Carolina. When it comes to family, she has always supported her sons in their basketball careers. Sonya also ensured that all her children attended college, and the mother herself received a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">degree in Education</a>.</p><h3>7. She is media savvy</h3><p class=align-left>Sonya has faced lots of media attention over the years.
